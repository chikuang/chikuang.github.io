**Only read if you wanna use school server**

# Which Operating System do you use?
  +  In all OS, you can use `Terminal` or `cmd` to connect, but I perfer not using it as a beginner.
  +  Windows, depends on the version of your OSâ€¦ but I strongly recommend using [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). Otherwise, you may use [Putty](https://www.putty.org/). In addition, I think [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) is a good choice to connect to the servers.
  +  MacOS, wellâ€¦ you may just use terminal. I think even `Screen Sharing client`, a default software works. Alternative, you may use [royal TSX.](https://www.royalapps.com/ts/mac/features)
  + Linux, I prefer [Remmina](https://remmina.org/).

# Download Cisco - the VPN software if you are off campus

  + [Waterloo Web](https://uwaterloo.ca/information-systems-technology/services/virtual-private-network-vpn)
  + Find the [installization guide](https://uwaterloo.ca/information-systems-technology/services/virtual-private-network-vpn/about-virtual-private-network-vpn#usingvpn) on the right hand side, and choose the appropriate OS.
  + Type your WatIAM ID and password to download.
  + Open Sever/connect to `cn-vpn-uwaterloo.ca` and type the account & password
  + You may need to obtain the second password using the `DUO mobile` app.

# Open the software and connect to the servers

1. Windows server - use [Microsoft RDP](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-remote-desktop/9wzdncrfj3ps?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) I think is the easiest way. Let me know if you do not know how to use.

    * The address is yourWatIAMid@windows.math.uwaterloo.ca

2. Linux servers - use the thing you download in the first place.
    * The address is `yourWatIAMid@cpuXXX.math.private.uwaterloo.ca`
  * Description can be found [HERE](yourWatIAMid@windows.math.uwaterloo.ca) and [HERE](yourWatIAMid@windows.math.uwaterloo.ca)
  * The description of the CPUs are in [HERE](yourWatIAMid@windows.math.uwaterloo.ca)

3. High-performance computing (HPC) & Graphics processing unit (GPU) cluster/server
    * It requires a bit more domain knowledgeâ€¦
    * There are some good readings, such as [1](https://uwaterloo.ca/math-faculty-computing-facility/sites/ca.math-faculty-computing-facility/files/uploads/files/gpu-review.pdf).
    * It can do good in parallel computing (you have more cores).

4. Check usage of the server you logged in
  & some commandsâ€¦ e.g. `htop`, `top` for memory usage, and [a lot more](https://www.binarytides.com/linux-commands-hardware-info/)

# Running code on the server

1. log onto the (Linux) server, say, cpu151.math.private.uwaterloo.ca

2. cd to the directory where your code is located.

3. Type `Rscript your_code.R` to run the code.

4. You may want to use the nohup command to run the code in the background. For example, `nohup Rscript your_code.R &`
