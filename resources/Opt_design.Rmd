## Introduction to Optimal Regression Design

In statistical modeling, especially in regression analysis, we often face the question:

> *"Where and how should we collect data to obtain the most accurate parameter estimates?"*

This question is answered by **Optimal Experimental Design**, a field that seeks to identify **the best sampling scheme** under a specified statistical model.

### üéØ General Objective

Let the model be a linear regression:

\[
Y_i = \mathbf{f}(x_i)^\top \boldsymbol{\beta} + \varepsilon_i,\quad \varepsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)
\]
where:
  - Note \( \boldsymbol{\beta} \in \mathbb{R}^p \) are the parameters to estimate,
  -  \( \mathbf{f}(x) \in \mathbb{R}^p \) is the regression basis (e.g., \( \mathbf{f}(x) = [1, x]^\top \)),
  - \( x_i \in \mathcal{X} \) are the design points in a compact design space.

The **Fisher Information Matrix** for a weighted design $\xi = \{(x_i, w_i)\}$ is:

\[
M(\xi) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i\, \mathbf{f}(x_i)\, \mathbf{f}(x_i)^\top
\]

We wish to **choose design weights** \( w_i \geq 0 \), \( \sum w_i = 1 \), to maximize information about \( \boldsymbol{\beta} \).

### üßÆ Common Optimality Criteria

| Criterion        |           Objective                |        Interpretation                       |
|:----------------:|:----------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
| **D-optimality** | Maximize \( \det M(\xi) \)         | Minimize volume of confidence ellipsoid     |
| **A-optimality** | Minimize \( \operatorname{tr}[M(\xi)^{-1}] \) | Minimize average variance of estimates |
| **E-optimality** | Maximize \( \lambda_{\min}(M(\xi)) \) | Minimize worst-case variance direction   |
Each criterion reflects a different goal:
- **D-opt** aims for overall information efficiency.
- **A-opt** targets average estimation precision.
- **E-opt** guards against poorly estimated directions.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Problem Statement

The optimal design problem is thus:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\max_{w \in \mathbb{R}^n} && \Phi(M(w)) \\
&\text{s.t.} && w_i \geq 0,\quad \sum_{i=1}^n w_i = 1
\end{aligned}
\]

where \( \Phi \) is one of the optimality criteria (e.g., \( \lambda_{\min}(M) \) for E-optimality).

This leads to a **convex optimization problem**, especially suitable for numerical methods using packages such as `CVXR`.

In the following sections, we demonstrate how to solve this optimization problem in **R**, using **E-optimality** as a case study.
