    "text": "1.1 Introduction to SAS\nQ: What is SAS?\nSAS (Statistical Analysis Software) is a prominent tool in the field of Data Analytics, offering a comprehensive suite for data manipulation, mining, management, and retrieval across various sources, coupled with robust statistical analysis capabilities. It excels in a range of functions including data management, statistical analysis, report generation, business modelling, application development, and data warehousing. SAS is user-friendly, featuring a point-and-click interface for those without technical expertise, while also providing deeper functionality through the SAS programming language. This software is instrumental in employing qualitative methods and processes that enhance employee productivity and business profitability.\nWithin SAS, data extraction and categorization into tables are pivotal for identifying and understanding data trends. This versatile suite supports advanced analytics, business intelligence, predictive analysis, and data management, facilitating effective operation in dynamic and compet- itive business environments. Additionally, SAS’s platform-independent nature allows it to operate seamlessly across various operating systems, including Linux, Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu. SAS provides extensive support to programmatically transform and analyze data in the comparison of drag and drop interface of other Business Intelligence tools. It provides very fine control over data manipulation and analysis.",

Once connected to the VPN, login to VLab at: https://vlab.gsu.edu/ to access SAS.\nOption 4:\nAccess via SAS OnDemand for Academics/SAS Studio. If you do not already have one, create a SAS profile at https://welcome.oda.sas.com/ Then, sign in with credentials and click SAS®Studio to access the web-based SAS environment.\n\n\n\n1.1.2 SAS Windows\nOnce SAS has started, the screen will look similar to the following: The main SAS window is divided into several sub-windows:\n\n\nThe menu and toolbar along the top of the window\nThe explorer/results browser along the left hand side, where you can a listing of the results of successful SAS program.\nThe log to the top right. This gives you information about possible errors after you have run your SAS program.\nThe program editor below the log on the bottom right, where you create your SAS program.\nThe windows bar along the bottom for you to switch all windows.\n\nThe Editor (Program Editor) window is a text editor that facilitates writing SAS programs (code). The Log window displays system messages, errors, and resource usage and is thus used to review program statements. The Output window displays output from statistical procedures run within the SAS program; however this is no longer the default. In SAS 9.3 output is sent to the Results Viewer which opens automatically when you run a procedure that generates output. The Results window displays a map of the Output window, and is useful for navigating the results of complicated analyses. Finally, the Explorer window contains all of the data sets in the current SAS session.\nThese windows can be moved or resized as desired. Only one SAS window is active at a time. The active window will have a shaded title bar at the top of the window, and a highlighted windows bar at the bottom of the screen. In the above example, the Program Editor is the active window, with an ”Untitled” program name. Note that the menu options for the SAS toolbar along the top of the screen depend on which window is currently active. (The active window can be changed by clicking on that window with the mouse, or by selecting the desired window from the Window menu.)",

    "text": "1.4 SAS Examples\n\n1.4.1 Creating a Dataset\nOur first task in using SAS will be to create a small dataset and “print” that dataset to the output window. As we mentioned in previous paragraph SAS programs usually start with a DATA step where the dataset is created. Once the dataset is available, various procedures can be run on the dataset. The example below is written in the SAS Program window. The program creates a dataset called “People” with 3 variables (columns) which are ‘gender’, ‘height’, and ‘weight’ and 14 observations (rows). Note that the values of the variables on each line are separated by one or more blanks. A few other things that you should note:\n\nAll SAS statements end with a semicolon (;)\nMore than one SAS statement can be put on a line, or a SAS statement can continue across several lines, if every statement ends with a semicolon.\nData listed as part of the program is also terminated with a semicolon. Data does not have to be entered in the program; it can also be read from files that are external to the SAS program (more on that next week)\ngender is a character variables as indicated by the $, and height and weight are numeric variables.\nOnce the dataset is created, various SAS procedures (called PROCs) can be used to analyze the data and present results. We will start with a listing of the data created with a procedure called PROC PRINT.\n\ntitle1 'STAT 8678 Example 1';\ntitle2 'Your name';\nDATA people;\nINPUT gender $ height weight;\n\nDATALINES;\nm 63 125\nm 76 195\nf 62 109\nm 75 186\nf 67 115\nf 60 120\nm 75 205\nm 71 185\nm 63 140\nf 59 135\nf 65 125\nm 68 167\nm 72 220\nf 66 155\n;\n\nPROC PRINT DATA=people;\nRUN;\nThe LOG window gives information on the execution of the program. If your program did not execute properly you should examine the log for error messages that may explain the failure. The program would then be modified if necessary and rerun.\nSAS creates a new window called the Results Viewer when the program is executed and produces output. This window is in HTML format and a new tab for the window is created below the left-hand windows.\n\n\n1.4.2 Sorting Data\nThe data can be sorted (in our case by gender) using PROC SORT by adding the following lines to the program. We can then go ahead and print our new dataset sorted by gender with the proc print step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteReminder\n\n\n\nAny procedural step we do must begin with PROC and every line must end with a semicolon and the command run;\n\n\nPROC SORT data = people;\nBY gender;\nRUN;\n\nPROC PRINT data=people;\nTITLE3 \"Raw data sorted only by gender\";\nRUN;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNote\n\n\n\nAny time we use PROC SORT our original dataset is sorted. SAS does not create a copy then sort!",

This makes it more structured. Also, consistent spacing also makes a SAS program easier to read.\nOverall, we can type SAS statements in the following ways:\nSometimes we may want to make comments/notes to easy remember our SAS statements or to let other people easily understand what our code want to say. These comments are text that SAS ignores during processing. You can use comments anywhere in a SAS program to document the purpose of the program, explain segments of the program, or mark SAS code as non-executing text.\nThere are two ways to insert comments in a SAS program:\nAvoid placing the /* comment symbols in columns 1 and 2.

    "text": "3.1 Reading from External Files\nOne of the strengths of SAS as a data analysis tool is its ability to read data from many sources, subset or combine data sets, and modify the datasets to accomplish various tasks. The most common types of external data sets used in SAS are EXCEL files (XLS extent), comma separated value files (CSV extent) and various space separate text files (PRN or TXT extent). A CSV file is actually a text file and can be read in any text reader (NOTEPAD or WORDPAD in Windows). In fact, the SAS files themselves, as well as the LOG and the LST files produced by a SAS by a batch submit, are also simple text files.\nThe PROC IMPORT statement is the best way to enter external data sets. The CSV file we will be using is called “grades.csv”. Download and save it in your favourite folder and mark the complete path to it. Then use the following code to import it, making sure you put the correct path on the DATAFILE argument.\nThe IMPORT statement reads the dataset and stores it as the value designated by “OUT” in this case it will be saved as “Grades” in the library “Work”.\nThe DBMS statement defines the type of input SAS should be reading. The following table gives you all the possible choices. The REPLACE argument forces SAS to overwrite any older datasets with the same name.\nThe GETNAMES = YES or NO statement for spreadsheets and delimited external files, determines whether to generate SAS variable names from the column names in the input file’s first row of data. If you specify GETNAMES = NO or if the column names are not valid SAS names, PROC IMPORT uses the variable names VAR0, VAR1, VAR2, and so on. You may replace the equals sign with a blank.\nThe DATAROW argument tells SAS where to start reading for input data. In our case it is row 2 since row 1 is used for variable names.\nWe use the print procedure to see the dataset,\nThe first few rows are shown as follows",

Some common continuous distributions are as follows.\n\n4.4.1 Normal Distribution\nThe normal distribution is also called the Gaussian distribution. It is characterized by two parameters: the mean \\(\\mu\\) and the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). It is unimodal and symmetric around the mean which is the centre of the mass. A continuous random variable \\(X\\) that has a normal distribution is said to be normal or normally distributed.\nNotation: \\(X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). Sometimes the standard deviation may be used instead of the variance, which is the square of the variance.\nInstitution of the normal distribution:\n\nmean: \\(\\mu\\)\nvariance: \\(\\sigma^2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA distribution plot of the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 is shown above. It is often referred as the standard normal distribution. In practice, we would like to “standardized” the data to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 for the subsequent analysis.\nNormal distribution play an important role in statistical inference. One of the important property is the 68-95-99.7 rule: - About 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean - About 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean - About 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations of the mean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Exponential Distribution\nThe exponential distribution is another common distribution where a few outcomes are most likely with a rapidly decreasing probability for larger values.

But to be sure which parameterization is used, we need to check the definition of the distribution.\n\nPlease define adequate random variables for the following data example, and thaink about what distribution can be used to model the data.\n\nSuppose we want to know whether the rate of diabetes of a certain area is too high.

    "text": "5.2 Example: One-Sample Mean Problem\nThe term one sample does not mean that there is only one observation.\nInstead, it means that there is one population under study.\nIn this problem, we are interested in making inference about the population mean, denoted by \\(\\mu\\).\n\n5.2.1 Problem Formulation\nSuppose we want to conduct statistical inference on the mean length of a certain type of court case. Let \\[\n\\mu = \\text{the mean length of a certain type of court case}.\n\\]\nHowever, the true value of \\(\\mu\\) is unknown because we cannot observe all realizations of this process. As a result, statistical inference is required.\nIf \\(\\mu\\) were known, no inference would be necessary.\nWhat we can do is to collect data: Suppose, we randomly select \\(20\\) cases from previous results under the same type of court. The data is\nWhat we can do in practice is to collect data.\nSuppose we randomly select 20 court cases of the same type from historical records and observe their case lengths (in days):\n\\[\n43,\\; 90,\\; 84,\\; 87,\\; 116,\\; 95,\\; 86,\\; 99,\\; 93,\\; 92,\n\\] \\[\n121,\\; 71,\\; 66,\\; 98,\\; 79,\\; 102,\\; 60,\\; 112,\\; 105,\\; 98.\n\\]\nFrom a statistical perspective, these observed values are treated as realizations of random variables. Specifically, we denote\n\\[\nX_1 = 43,\\; X_2 = 90,\\; \\ldots,\\; X_{20} = 98.\n\\]\nTo model the data, we assume that the random variables \\[\nX_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_{20}\n\\] are independent and identically distributed according to a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), that is,\n\\[\nX_i \\stackrel{\\text{i.i.d.}}{\\sim} N(\\mu, \\sigma^2),\n\\qquad i = 1, \\ldots, 20.\n\\]\nHere, both \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) are unknown parameters. In this example, our primary interest lies in estimating the population mean \\(\\\\mu\\), while the variance \\(\\\\sigma^2\\) is treated as a nuisance parameter.\nWe can use the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) or the method of moments estimator (MME) to construct a point estimator of \\(\\mu\\). Under this model, however, they are coincide. The resulting estimator is the sample mean, denoted by\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mu} = \\bar{X}_{20},\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n\\bar{X}_{20} = \\frac{1}{20} \\sum_{i=1}^{20} X_i.\n\\]\nUnder the assumed model, we may use either the maximum likelihood estimator or the method of moments to construct a point estimator for the population mean \\(\\mu\\). In this model, both methods lead to the same estimator: the sample mean. We denote this estimator by\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mu} = \\bar{X}.\n\\]\nPay careful attention to the notation. We use a capital letter \\(\\bar{X}\\) to emphasize that the estimator itself is a random variable. Since the estimator is a function of the random variables \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\), it is also random and therefore follows a probability distribution.\nThe probability distribution of an estimator is called its sampling distribution. We will return to the concept of sampling distributions later in the course.\n\n\n5.2.2 Formal Definitions\nTo be more precise, we introduce the following definitions.\n\nA statistic is any function of the random variables \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\).\nBecause it is a function of random variables, a statistic is itself a random variable and therefore has a probability distribution.\nA (point) estimator of a parameter \\(\\theta\\), denoted by \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\), is a statistic used to estimate \\(\\theta\\). Consequently, an estimator is a random variable.\nA (point) estimate is the numerical value obtained by evaluating the estimator using the observed data \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\).\n\nIn particular, we use lowercase notation to indicate an estimate. For example, \\(\\bar{x}\\) denotes the observed value of the estimator \\(\\bar{X}\\).",
