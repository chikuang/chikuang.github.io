    "text": "1.1 Introduction to SAS\nQ: What is SAS?\nSAS (Statistical Analysis Software) is a prominent tool in the field of Data Analytics, offering a comprehensive suite for data manipulation, mining, management, and retrieval across various sources, coupled with robust statistical analysis capabilities. It excels in a range of functions including data management, statistical analysis, report generation, business modelling, application development, and data warehousing. SAS is user-friendly, featuring a point-and-click interface for those without technical expertise, while also providing deeper functionality through the SAS programming language. This software is instrumental in employing qualitative methods and processes that enhance employee productivity and business profitability.\nWithin SAS, data extraction and categorization into tables are pivotal for identifying and understanding data trends. This versatile suite supports advanced analytics, business intelligence, predictive analysis, and data management, facilitating effective operation in dynamic and compet- itive business environments. Additionally, SAS’s platform-independent nature allows it to operate seamlessly across various operating systems, including Linux, Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu. SAS provides extensive support to programmatically transform and analyze data in the comparison of drag and drop interface of other Business Intelligence tools. It provides very fine control over data manipulation and analysis.",

Once connected to the VPN, login to VLab at: https://vlab.gsu.edu/ to access SAS.\nOption 4:\nAccess via SAS OnDemand for Academics/SAS Studio. If you do not already have one, create a SAS profile at https://welcome.oda.sas.com/ Then, sign in with credentials and click SAS®Studio to access the web-based SAS environment.\n\n\n\n1.1.2 SAS Windows\nOnce SAS has started, the screen will look similar to the following: The main SAS window is divided into several sub-windows:\n\n\nThe menu and toolbar along the top of the window\nThe explorer/results browser along the left hand side, where you can a listing of the results of successful SAS program.\nThe log to the top right. This gives you information about possible errors after you have run your SAS program.\nThe program editor below the log on the bottom right, where you create your SAS program.\nThe windows bar along the bottom for you to switch all windows.\n\nThe Editor (Program Editor) window is a text editor that facilitates writing SAS programs (code). The Log window displays system messages, errors, and resource usage and is thus used to review program statements. The Output window displays output from statistical procedures run within the SAS program; however this is no longer the default. In SAS 9.3 output is sent to the Results Viewer which opens automatically when you run a procedure that generates output. The Results window displays a map of the Output window, and is useful for navigating the results of complicated analyses. Finally, the Explorer window contains all of the data sets in the current SAS session.\nThese windows can be moved or resized as desired. Only one SAS window is active at a time. The active window will have a shaded title bar at the top of the window, and a highlighted windows bar at the bottom of the screen. In the above example, the Program Editor is the active window, with an ”Untitled” program name. Note that the menu options for the SAS toolbar along the top of the screen depend on which window is currently active. (The active window can be changed by clicking on that window with the mouse, or by selecting the desired window from the Window menu.)",

    "text": "1.4 SAS Examples\n\n1.4.1 Creating a Dataset\nOur first task in using SAS will be to create a small dataset and “print” that dataset to the output window. As we mentioned in previous paragraph SAS programs usually start with a DATA step where the dataset is created. Once the dataset is available, various procedures can be run on the dataset. The example below is written in the SAS Program window. The program creates a dataset called “People” with 3 variables (columns) which are ‘gender’, ‘height’, and ‘weight’ and 14 observations (rows). Note that the values of the variables on each line are separated by one or more blanks. A few other things that you should note:\n\nAll SAS statements end with a semicolon (;)\nMore than one SAS statement can be put on a line, or a SAS statement can continue across several lines, if every statement ends with a semicolon.\nData listed as part of the program is also terminated with a semicolon. Data does not have to be entered in the program; it can also be read from files that are external to the SAS program (more on that next week)\ngender is a character variables as indicated by the $, and height and weight are numeric variables.\nOnce the dataset is created, various SAS procedures (called PROCs) can be used to analyze the data and present results. We will start with a listing of the data created with a procedure called PROC PRINT.\n\ntitle1 'STAT 8678 Example 1';\ntitle2 'Your name';\nDATA people;\nINPUT gender $ height weight;\n\nDATALINES;\nm 63 125\nm 76 195\nf 62 109\nm 75 186\nf 67 115\nf 60 120\nm 75 205\nm 71 185\nm 63 140\nf 59 135\nf 65 125\nm 68 167\nm 72 220\nf 66 155\n;\n\nPROC PRINT DATA=people;\nRUN;\nThe LOG window gives information on the execution of the program. If your program did not execute properly you should examine the log for error messages that may explain the failure. The program would then be modified if necessary and rerun.\nSAS creates a new window called the Results Viewer when the program is executed and produces output. This window is in HTML format and a new tab for the window is created below the left-hand windows.\n\n\n1.4.2 Sorting Data\nThe data can be sorted (in our case by gender) using PROC SORT by adding the following lines to the program. We can then go ahead and print our new dataset sorted by gender with the proc print step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteReminder\n\n\n\nAny procedural step we do must begin with PROC and every line must end with a semicolon and the command run;\n\n\nPROC SORT data = people;\nBY gender;\nRUN;\n\nPROC PRINT data=people;\nTITLE3 \"Raw data sorted only by gender\";\nRUN;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNote\n\n\n\nAny time we use PROC SORT our original dataset is sorted. SAS does not create a copy then sort!",

This makes it more structured. Also, consistent spacing also makes a SAS program easier to read.\nOverall, we can type SAS statements in the following ways:\nSometimes we may want to make comments/notes to easy remember our SAS statements or to let other people easily understand what our code want to say. These comments are text that SAS ignores during processing. You can use comments anywhere in a SAS program to document the purpose of the program, explain segments of the program, or mark SAS code as non-executing text.\nThere are two ways to insert comments in a SAS program:\nAvoid placing the /* comment symbols in columns 1 and 2.

    "text": "3.1 Reading from External Files\nOne of the strengths of SAS as a data analysis tool is its ability to read data from many sources, subset or combine data sets, and modify the datasets to accomplish various tasks. The most common types of external data sets used in SAS are EXCEL files (XLS extent), comma separated value files (CSV extent) and various space separate text files (PRN or TXT extent). A CSV file is actually a text file and can be read in any text reader (NOTEPAD or WORDPAD in Windows). In fact, the SAS files themselves, as well as the LOG and the LST files produced by a SAS by a batch submit, are also simple text files.\nThe PROC IMPORT statement is the best way to enter external data sets. The CSV file we will be using is called “grades.csv”. Download and save it in your favourite folder and mark the complete path to it. Then use the following code to import it, making sure you put the correct path on the DATAFILE argument.\nThe IMPORT statement reads the dataset and stores it as the value designated by “OUT” in this case it will be saved as “Grades” in the library “Work”.\nThe DBMS statement defines the type of input SAS should be reading. The following table gives you all the possible choices. The REPLACE argument forces SAS to overwrite any older datasets with the same name.\nThe GETNAMES = YES or NO statement for spreadsheets and delimited external files, determines whether to generate SAS variable names from the column names in the input file’s first row of data. If you specify GETNAMES = NO or if the column names are not valid SAS names, PROC IMPORT uses the variable names VAR0, VAR1, VAR2, and so on. You may replace the equals sign with a blank.\nThe DATAROW argument tells SAS where to start reading for input data. In our case it is row 2 since row 1 is used for variable names.\nWe use the print procedure to see the dataset,\nThe first few rows are shown as follows",

Some common continuous distributions are as follows.\n\n4.4.1 Normal Distribution\nThe normal distribution is also called the Gaussian distribution. It is characterized by two parameters: the mean \\(\\mu\\) and the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). It is unimodal and symmetric around the mean which is the centre of the mass. A continuous random variable \\(X\\) that has a normal distribution is said to be normal or normally distributed.\nNotation: \\(X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). Sometimes the standard deviation may be used instead of the variance, which is the square of the variance.\nInstitution of the normal distribution:\n\nmean: \\(\\mu\\)\nvariance: \\(\\sigma^2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA distribution plot of the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 is shown above. It is often referred as the standard normal distribution. In practice, we would like to “standardized” the data to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 for the subsequent analysis.\nNormal distribution play an important role in statistical inference. One of the important property is the 68-95-99.7 rule: - About 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean - About 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean - About 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations of the mean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Exponential Distribution\nThe exponential distribution is another common distribution where a few outcomes are most likely with a rapidly decreasing probability for larger values.

But to be sure which parameterization is used, we need to check the definition of the distribution.\n\nPlease define adequate random variables for the following data example, and thaink about what distribution can be used to model the data.\n\nSuppose we want to know whether the rate of diabetes of a certain area is too high.

    "section": "5.2 Example: One-Sample Mean Problem",
    "text": "5.2 Example: One-Sample Mean Problem\nThe term one sample does not mean that there is only one observation. Instead, it means that there is one population under study.\nIn this problem, we are interested in making inference about the population mean, denoted by \\(\\mu\\).\n\n5.2.1 Problem Formulation\nSuppose we want to conduct statistical inference on the mean length of a certain type of court case. Let \\[\n\\mu = \\text{the mean length of a certain type of court case}.\n\\]\nHowever, the true value of \\(\\mu\\) is unknown because we cannot observe all realizations of this process. As a result, statistical inference is required.\nIf \\(\\mu\\) were known, no inference would be necessary. What we can do in practice is to collect data. Suppose we randomly select 20 court cases of the same type from historical records and observe their case lengths (in days):\n\\[\n43,\\; 90,\\; 84,\\; 87,\\; 116,\\; 95,\\; 86,\\; 99,\\; 93,\\; 92,\n\\] \\[\n121,\\; 71,\\; 66,\\; 98,\\; 79,\\; 102,\\; 60,\\; 112,\\; 105,\\; 98.\n\\]\nFrom a statistical perspective, these observed values are treated as realizations of random variables. Specifically, we denote\n\\[\nX_1 = 43,\\; X_2 = 90,\\; \\ldots,\\; X_{20} = 98.\n\\]\nTo model the data, we assume that the random variables \\[\nX_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_{20}\n\\] are independent and identically distributed according to a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), that is,\n\\[\nX_i \\stackrel{\\text{i.i.d.}}{\\sim} N(\\mu, \\sigma^2),\n\\qquad i = 1, \\ldots, 20.\n\\]\nHere, both \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) are unknown parameters. In this example, our primary interest lies in estimating the population mean \\(\\mu\\), while the variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) is treated as a nuisance parameter.\nWe can use the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) or the method of moments estimator (MME) to construct a point estimator of \\(\\mu\\). Under this model, however, they are coincide. The resulting estimator is the sample mean, denoted by\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mu} = \\bar{X}_{20},\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n\\bar{X}_{20} = \\frac{1}{20} \\sum_{i=1}^{20} X_i.\n\\]\nUnder the assumed model, we may use either the maximum likelihood estimator or the method of moments to construct a point estimator for the population mean \\(\\mu\\). In this model, both methods lead to the same estimator: the sample mean. We denote this estimator by\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mu} = \\bar{X}_n.\n\\]\nPay careful attention to the notation. We use a capital letter \\(\\bar{X}_n\\) to emphasize that the estimator itself is a random variable. Since the estimator is a function of the random variables \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\), it is also random and therefore follows a probability distribution. The probability distribution of an estimator is called its sampling distribution. We will return to the concept of sampling distributions later in the course.\n\n\n5.2.2 Formal Definitions\nTo be more precise, we introduce the following definitions.\n\nA statistic is any function of the random variables \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\). Because it is a function of random variables, a statistic is itself a random variable and therefore has a probability distribution. If we use the parametric model to describe it, then there is a distribution that depends on the unknown parameters.\nA (point) estimator of a parameter \\(\\theta\\), denoted by \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\), is a statistic used to estimate \\(\\theta\\). (Note, an estimator is a random variable because it is a statistics).\nA (point) estimate is the numerical value obtained by evaluating the estimator using the observed data \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\). In particular, we use lowercase notation to indicate an estimate. For example, \\(\\bar{x}_n\\) denotes the observed value of the estimator \\(\\bar{X}_n\\).\n\nSo far, we have constructed a point estimator (and hence a point estimate). To construct a confidence interval or perform hypothesis testing, we need to know the sampling distribution of the estimator \\(\\bar{X}_n\\).\nUnder the normal model with unknown variance, the sampling distribution can be expressed as\n\\[\n\\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{S / \\sqrt{n}} \\sim t_{n-1},\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\nS = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\bar{X})^2}{n - 1}},\n\\]\nand \\(t_{n-1}\\) denotes the Student’s \\(t\\) distribution with \\(n - 1\\) degrees of freedom.\n\n\n5.2.3 Confidence Interval for \\(\\mu\\)\nBased on this sampling distribution, a \\((1 - \\alpha) \\times 100\\%\\) confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\) is given by\n\\[\n\\left[\n\\bar{X} - t_{n-1,\\alpha/2} \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}},\n\\;\n\\bar{X} + t_{n-1,\\alpha/2} \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\\right].\n\\]\n\n\n5.2.4 Hypothesis Testing for \\(\\mu\\)\nUsing the same sampling distribution, we can conduct one of the following hypothesis tests:\n\nTwo-sided test \\[\nH_0: \\mu = \\mu_0\n\\quad \\text{vs.} \\quad\nH_1: \\mu \\neq \\mu_0\n\\]\nLeft-tailed test \\[\nH_0: \\mu = \\mu_0\n\\quad \\text{vs.} \\quad\nH_1: \\mu &lt; \\mu_0\n\\]\nRight-tailed test \\[\nH_0: \\mu = \\mu_0\n\\quad \\text{vs.} \\quad\nH_1: \\mu &gt; \\mu_0\n\\]\n\nIn some textbooks, equivalent hypotheses are written as\n\n\\[\nH_0: \\mu = \\mu_0\n\\quad \\text{vs.} \\quad\nH_1: \\mu \\neq \\mu_0\n\\]\n\\[\nH_0: \\mu \\ge \\mu_0\n\\quad \\text{vs.} \\quad\nH_1: \\mu &lt; \\mu_0\n\\]\n\\[\nH_0: \\mu \\le \\mu_0\n\\quad \\text{vs.} \\quad\nH_1: \\mu &gt; \\mu_0\n\\]\n\nFortunately, SAS can perform point estimation, confidence interval construction, and hypothesis testing simultaneously, provided we clearly specify:\n\nThe statistical question\n(one-sample mean, one-sample variance, two-sample problem, etc.)\nThe inferential goal\n(point estimation, confidence interval, hypothesis testing)\nThe statistical model and method\n(for example, why we use the \\(t\\) distribution for the one-sample mean problem instead of the normal distribution or another alternative)\n\nOne of the main goals of this course is to help you build a mental “library” of statistical tools. Later, when you encounter a statistical question, you will be able to identify an appropriate method and then use SAS to obtain numerical results for interpretation.",

    "text": "6.2 Model Diagnostics\nIn this step, we pause and think carefully about the assumptions underlying our analysis.\nQuestion:\n\nWhat statistical models are we implementing?\n\nIn this course, the key assumptions for the one-sample mean problem are:\n\nA normality assumption\nAn independence assumption\n\nThe independence assumption is primarily determined by how the data are collected. Once the data have been sampled, this assumption is generally not testable from the data alone.\nWe therefore assume that the sampling process was conducted correctly and focus our attention on checking the normality assumption.\nThere are two types of methods\nThere are two broad classes of methods:\n\nGraphical (visual) diagnostics\nFormal hypothesis testing methods\n\n\n6.2.1 Graphical Diagnostics for Normality\nCommon graphical tools include:\n\nHistogram and Density Plots:\nA kernel density estimate (KDE) provides a smooth estimate of the underlying probability density function, analogous to a histogram but without binning. KDEs represent the data using a continuous curve and are particularly useful for visualizing distributional shape.\nQ–Q Plot (Quantile–Quantile Plot)\nA Q–Q plot compares empirical quantiles of the observed data with theoretical quantiles from a normal distribution.\nIf the normality assumption is reasonable, the points should fall approximately along a straight line.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Formal Hypothesis Testing for Normality\nIn addition to graphical methods, we can also assess the normality assumption using formal numerical tests.\nOne commonly used method is the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) test, which evaluates whether a sample plausibly comes from a specified distribution, such as the normal distribution.\nThe K–S test is widely used because many statistical procedures rely on the assumption that the data are normally distributed. When this assumption is violated, standard inference procedures may no longer be valid. The following step-by-step example demonstrates how to perform a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for normality using SAS.\nStep 1: Create the dataset\nDATA time;\n    INPUT time @@;\n    DATALINES;\n43 90 84 87 116 95 86 99 93 92\n121 71 66 98 79 102 60 112 105 98\n;\nRUN;\nStep 2: Perform the normality test\n/* Perform Kolmogorov–Smirnov test */\nPROC UNIVARIATE DATA=time;\n    HISTOGRAM time / NORMAL(mu=est sigma=est);\nRUN;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteRemarks\n\n\n\nGraphical diagnostics are informal but highly informative.\nThey allow us to detect skewness, heavy tails, and outliers that may invalidate normal-based inference.\nFormal hypothesis tests for normality will be introduced next, but should always be interpreted in conjunction with these visual tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteImportant Note\n\n\n\nFor the best practice:\nNever rely on a single normality test.

    "section": "6.3 Interpretation of Results",
    "text": "6.3 Interpretation of Results\n\n6.3.1 Point Estimation\nPoint estimation is the process of using sample data to compute a single numerical value that estimates an unknown population parameter, such as the population mean.\nWhen we report a point estimate, it is desirable to understand whether the estimator has good statistical properties. In particular, we often examine whether a point estimator is:\n\nConsistent: As the sample size increases, the estimator becomes closer to the true parameter value.\nUnbiased: The expected value of the estimator equals the true population parameter. For example, the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean.\nEfficient (or best unbiased): Among all unbiased and consistent estimators, it has the smallest variance, meaning the estimator varies less from sample to sample.\n\nHow to rigorously verify these properties is a major topic in theoretical statistics courses. In practice, when these properties are unknown or difficult to assess, the safest interpretation of a point estimate is simply to report it with its associated unit. For example, using the court length data, we may state:\n\nA reasonable estimate for the average court length is approximately 89.85 days.\n\n\n\n6.3.2 Confidence Intervals\nA confidence interval (CI) provides a range of plausible values for an unknown population parameter. A common—but informal—interpretation of a 95% confidence interval is that we are “95% confident” the true parameter lies within the interval. While this interpretation is widely used, the strictly correct interpretation is based on repeated sampling:\n\nIf the same study were repeated infinitely many times, and a 95% confidence interval were constructed each time, then approximately 95% of those intervals would contain the true parameter value.\n\nAs an example, suppose the 90% confidence interval for the population mean court length is \\([15.2,\\; 26.2].\\) This means that, under the confidence interval procedure used, intervals constructed in this way would contain the true mean in 90% of repeated samples.\nFactors Affecting Confidence Interval Width\nThe width of a confidence interval depends on several factors:\n\nSample size\nLarger samples typically produce narrower (more precise) confidence intervals.\nVariability of the outcome\nFor continuous outcomes, higher variability (larger standard deviation) leads to wider intervals.\nOutcome type\n\nFor binary outcomes, precision depends on the event probability.\nFor time-to-event outcomes, precision depends on the number of observed events.\n\n\nAll of these factors influence the standard error of the estimator, which directly determines the width of the confidence interval.\n\n\n6.3.3 Hypothesis Testing\nHypothesis testing evaluates whether observed data are consistent with a specified statistical assumption, typically called the null hypothesis.\nThe result of a hypothesis test allows us to decide whether the assumption is supported by the data or whether there is sufficient evidence to reject it. The strength of this evidence is quantified by the p-value.\nA p-value is defined as:\n\nThe probability of observing data at least as extreme as the data actually observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n\nFor example, if a hypothesis test yields a p-value of 0.01, this means that—if the null hypothesis were true—there would be only a 1% chance of observing data this extreme.\nA small p-value provides evidence against the null hypothesis, while a large p-value indicates that the data are consistent with it.\nIf the observed data are very unlikely to occur under the conditions described by the null hypothesis, then the null hypothesis is unlikely to be true. In such cases, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis, and the result is said to be statistically significant.\nA commonly used decision rule is based on a significance level of 0.05. If the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, this is typically taken as evidence against the null hypothesis, and we reject it in favor of the alternative hypothesis. However, a p-value cannot be used to prove that a hypothesis is true. Instead, it quantifies the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\nConsider the court length data. Suppose we conduct a hypothesis test with \\[\nH_0: \\mu = 80\n\\quad \\text{versus} \\quad\nH_1: \\mu &gt; 80,\n\\] and obtain a p-value of 0.0164.\nIf we choose a significance level of 0.05, then since \\(0.0164 &lt; 0.05,\\)\nwe reject the null hypothesis. At the 5% significance level, there is strong statistical evidence that the population mean court length is not equal to 80.\nWhen the p-value Is Large\nIf the p-value is greater than 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis. This does not mean that the null hypothesis is true. Rather, it means that the data do not provide strong enough evidence to conclude that the population mean court length differs from 80.\nIn hypothesis testing, failing to reject the null hypothesis should be interpreted as insufficient evidence, not as confirmation of the null hypothesis.",

If the normality assumption required for a one-sample t-test is questionable, nonparametric alternatives provide a robust solution.\nBy default, both tests examine the hypothesis that the median of the population from which the sample is drawn is equal to a specific value,s which is zero by dafault.

If you use a VAR statement, the variables listed in a plot statement must be a subset of the variables listed in the VAR statement.\nYou can specify a BY statement to obtain separate analyses for each BY group. The FREQ statement specifies a variable whose values provide the frequency for each observation. The ID statement specifies one or more variables to identify the extreme observations. The WEIGHT statement specifies a variable whose values are used to weight certain statistics.\nYou can use a CLASS statement to specify one or two variables that group the data into classification levels.

You can use the CLASS statement with plot statements to create comparative displays, in which each cell contains a plot for one combination of classification levels.\n\nWe revisit the court length example to demonstrate how one-sample nonparametric tests can be used as an alternative or complement to the one-sample t-test.\nSuppose that, for some reason, we believe the t-test may not be an appropriate choice—perhaps due to concerns about normality—or we simply wish to double-check our conclusions using nonparametric methods.
