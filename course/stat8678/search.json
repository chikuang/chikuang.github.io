    "text": "1.1 Introduction to SAS\nLearning objective:\nQ: Wha is SAS?\nSAS (Statistical Analysis Software) is a prominent tool in the field of Data Analytics, offering a comprehensive suite for data manipulation, mining, management, and retrieval across various sources, coupled with robust statistical analysis capabilities. It excels in a range of functions including data management, statistical analysis, report generation, business modelling, application development, and data warehousing. SAS is user-friendly, featuring a point-and-click interface for those without technical expertise, while also providing deeper functionality through the SAS programming language. This software is instrumental in employing qualitative methods and processes that enhance employee productivity and business profitability.\nWithin SAS, data extraction and categorization into tables are pivotal for identifying and understanding data trends. This versatile suite supports advanced analytics, business intelligence, predictive analysis, and data management, facilitating effective operation in dynamic and compet- itive business environments. Additionally, SAS’s platform-independent nature allows it to operate seamlessly across various operating systems, including Linux, Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu. SAS provides extensive support to programmatically transform and analyze data in the comparison of drag and drop interface of other Business Intelligence tools. It provides very fine control over data manipulation and analysis.",
