    "text": "1.1 Introduction to SAS\nQ: What is SAS?\nSAS (Statistical Analysis Software) is a prominent tool in the field of Data Analytics, offering a comprehensive suite for data manipulation, mining, management, and retrieval across various sources, coupled with robust statistical analysis capabilities. It excels in a range of functions including data management, statistical analysis, report generation, business modelling, application development, and data warehousing. SAS is user-friendly, featuring a point-and-click interface for those without technical expertise, while also providing deeper functionality through the SAS programming language. This software is instrumental in employing qualitative methods and processes that enhance employee productivity and business profitability.\nWithin SAS, data extraction and categorization into tables are pivotal for identifying and understanding data trends. This versatile suite supports advanced analytics, business intelligence, predictive analysis, and data management, facilitating effective operation in dynamic and compet- itive business environments. Additionally, SAS’s platform-independent nature allows it to operate seamlessly across various operating systems, including Linux, Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu. SAS provides extensive support to programmatically transform and analyze data in the comparison of drag and drop interface of other Business Intelligence tools. It provides very fine control over data manipulation and analysis.",

This gives you information about possible errors after you have run your SAS program.\nThe program editor below the log on the bottom right, where you create your SAS program.\nThe windows bar along the bottom for you to switch all windows.\n\nThe Editor (Program Editor) window is a text editor that facilitates writing SAS programs (code). The Log window displays system messages, errors, and resource usage and is thus used to review program statements. The Output window displays output from statistical procedures run within the SAS program; however this is no longer the default. In SAS 9.3 output is sent to the Results Viewer which opens automatically when you run a procedure that generates output. The Results window displays a map of the Output window, and is useful for navigating the results of complicated analyses. Finally, the Explorer window contains all of the data sets in the current SAS session.\nThese windows can be moved or resized as desired. Only one SAS window is active at a time. The active window will have a shaded title bar at the top of the window, and a highlighted windows bar at the bottom of the screen. In the above example, the Program Editor is the active window, with an ”Untitled” program name. Note that the menu options for the SAS toolbar along the top of the screen depend on which window is currently active. (The active window can be changed by clicking on that window with the mouse, or by selecting the desired window from the Window menu.)",

    "text": "1.4 SAS Examples\n\n1.4.1 Creating a Dataset\nOur first task in using SAS will be to create a small dataset and “print” that dataset to the output window. As we mentioned in previous paragraph SAS programs usually start with a DATA step where the dataset is created. Once the dataset is available, various procedures can be run on the dataset. The example below is written in the SAS Program window. The program creates a dataset called “People” with 3 variables (columns) which are ‘gender’, ‘height’, and ‘weight’ and 14 observations (rows). Note that the values of the variables on each line are separated by one or more blanks. A few other things that you should note:\n\nAll SAS statements end with a semicolon (;)\nMore than one SAS statement can be put on a line, or a SAS statement can continue across several lines, if every statement ends with a semicolon.\nData listed as part of the program is also terminated with a semicolon. Data does not have to be entered in the program; it can also be read from files that are external to the SAS program (more on that next week)\ngender is a character variables as indicated by the $, and height and weight are numeric variables.\nOnce the dataset is created, various SAS procedures (called PROCs) can be used to analyze the data and present results. We will start with a listing of the data created with a procedure called PROC PRINT.\n\ntitle1 'STAT 8678 Example 1';\ntitle2 'Your name';\nDATA people;\nINPUT gender $ height weight;\n\nDATALINES;\nm 63 125\nm 76 195\nf 62 109\nm 75 186\nf 67 115\nf 60 120\nm 75 205\nm 71 185\nm 63 140\nf 59 135\nf 65 125\nm 68 167\nm 72 220\nf 66 155\n;\n\nPROC PRINT DATA=people;\nRUN;\nThe LOG window gives information on the execution of the program. If your program did not execute properly you should examine the log for error messages that may explain the failure. The program would then be modified if necessary and rerun.\nSAS creates a new window called the Results Viewer when the program is executed and produces output. This window is in HTML format and a new tab for the window is created below the left-hand windows.\n\n\n1.4.2 Sorting Data\nThe data can be sorted (in our case by gender) using PROC SORT by adding the following lines to the program. We can then go ahead and print our new dataset sorted by gender with the proc print step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteReminder\n\n\n\nAny procedural step we do must begin with PROC and every line must end with a semicolon and the command run;\n\n\nPROC SORT data = people;\nBY gender;\nRUN;\n\nPROC PRINT data=people;\nTITLE3 \"Raw data sorted only by gender\";\nRUN;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNote\n\n\n\nAny time we use PROC SORT our original dataset is sorted. SAS does not create a copy then sort!",

This makes it more structured. Also, consistent spacing also makes a SAS program easier to read.\nOverall, we can type SAS statements in the following ways:\nSometimes we may want to make comments/notes to easy remember our SAS statements or to let other people easily understand what our code want to say. These comments are text that SAS ignores during processing. You can use comments anywhere in a SAS program to document the purpose of the program, explain segments of the program, or mark SAS code as non-executing text.\nThere are two ways to insert comments in a SAS program:\nAvoid placing the /* comment symbols in columns 1 and 2.

    "text": "3.1 Reading from External Files\nOne of the strengths of SAS as a data analysis tool is its ability to read data from many sources, subset or combine data sets, and modify the datasets to accomplish various tasks. The most common types of external data sets used in SAS are EXCEL files (XLS extent), comma separated value files (CSV extent) and various space separate text files (PRN or TXT extent). A CSV file is actually a text file and can be read in any text reader (NOTEPAD or WORDPAD in Windows). In fact, the SAS files themselves, as well as the LOG and the LST files produced by a SAS by a batch submit, are also simple text files.\nThe PROC IMPORT statement is the best way to enter external data sets. The CSV file we will be using is called “grades.csv”. Download and save it in your favourite folder and mark the complete path to it. Then use the following code to import it, making sure you put the correct path on the DATAFILE argument.\nThe IMPORT statement reads the dataset and stores it as the value designated by “OUT” in this case it will be saved as “Grades” in the library “Work”.\nThe DBMS statement defines the type of input SAS should be reading. The following table gives you all the possible choices. The REPLACE argument forces SAS to overwrite any older datasets with the same name.\nThe GETNAMES = YES or NO statement for spreadsheets and delimited external files, determines whether to generate SAS variable names from the column names in the input file’s first row of data. If you specify GETNAMES = NO or if the column names are not valid SAS names, PROC IMPORT uses the variable names VAR0, VAR1, VAR2, and so on. You may replace the equals sign with a blank.\nThe DATAROW argument tells SAS where to start reading for input data. In our case it is row 2 since row 1 is used for variable names.\nWe use the print procedure to see the dataset,\nThe first few rows are shown as follows",

This can be done by the following SAS code\nDATA GRADES;\n  SET GRADES_temp NOBS=COUNT\n    IF _n_        &lt;= 1 THEN DELETE;\nRUN;\nNote: GRADES_temp is the name of the old dataset and GRADES is the name of the new dataset after the first row is deleted.\nAfter re-organize the dataset, we may want to export the updated dataset for use in the future:\nThis can be done by\nPROC EXPORT DATA= GRADES\n  OUTFILE= \"Put Your Path Here/grade_v2.csv\"\n  DBMS=CSV REPLACE;\n  REPLACE;\nRUN;\nWe will talk about more reorganizing skills in SAS in the next topic.\n\nWhich statement is true concerning the DATALINES statement based on reading the comment?\n\nThe DATALINES statement is used when reading data located in a raw data file.\nThe DATALINES statement is used when reading data located directly in the program.",
