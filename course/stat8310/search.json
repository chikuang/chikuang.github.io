Let {H1,H2,H3,H4} be the events that a randomly selected person in this sample is in, respectively, the lower 25th percentile, the second 25th percentile, the third 25th percentile and the upper 25th percentile in terms of income.

Let \\(E\\) be the event that a randomly sampled person from the survey has a college education. From the survey data, we have \\[\\{\\mathrm{Pr}(E\\mid H_1), \\mathrm{Pr}(E\\mid H_2),\\mathrm{Pr}(E\\mid H_3), \\mathrm{Pr}(E\\mid H_4)\\} = \\{.11, .19, .31, .53\\}.\\] These probabilities do not sum to 1 - they represent the proportions of people with college degrees in the four different income subpopulations \\(H_1, H_2, H_3\\) and \\(H_4\\). Now let’s consider the income distribution of the college-educated population. Using Bayes’ rule we can obtain\n\\(\\{\\mathrm{Pr}(H_1\\mid E), \\mathrm{Pr}(H_2\\mid E), \\mathrm{Pr}(H_3\\mid E), \\mathrm{Pr}(H_4 \\mid E)\\} = \\{0.09, 0.17, 0.27, 0.47\\} ,\\) and we see that the income distribution for people in the college-educated population differs markedly from \\(\\{0.25, 0.25,0.25,0.25\\}\\), the distribution for the general population. Note that these probabilities do sum to 1 - they are the conditional probabilities of the events in the partition, given \\(E\\).\n\nIn Bayesian inference, \\({H_1, . . . ,H_K}\\) often refer to disjoint hypotheses or states of nature and \\(E\\) refers to the outcome of a survey, study or experiment. To compare hypotheses post-experimentally, we often calculate the following ratio: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_i \\mid E\\right)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_j \\mid E\\right)} & =\\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(E \\mid H_i\\right) \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_i\\right) / \\operatorname{Pr}(E)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(E \\mid H_j\\right) \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_j\\right) / \\operatorname{Pr}(E)} \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(E \\mid H_i\\right) \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_i\\right)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(E \\mid H_j\\right) \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_j\\right)} \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(E \\mid H_i\\right)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(E \\mid H_j\\right)} \\times \\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_i\\right)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_j\\right)} \\\\\n& =\\text { \"Bayes factor\" × \"prior beliefs\". }\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] This calculation reminds us that Bayes’ rule does not determine what our beliefs should be after seeing the data, it only tells us how they should change after seeing the data.",

    "text": "2.4 Random Variables\nIn Bayesian inference a random variable is defined as an unknown numerical quantity about which we make probability statements. For example, the quantitative outcome of a survey, experiment or study is a random variable before the study is performed. Additionally, a fixed but unknown population parameter is also a random variable\n\n2.4.1 Discrete Ramdon variables\nLet \\(Y\\) be a random variable and let \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) be the set of all possible values that \\(Y\\) can take. If \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) is countable, meaning that \\(\\mathcal{Y} = \\{y_1,y_2,\\dots\\}\\), then \\(Y\\) is a discrete random variable.\n\nThe event that the outcome \\(Y\\) of our survey has the value \\(Y\\) is expressed as \\(\\{Y=y\\}\\). For each \\(y\\in\\mathcal{Y}\\), the shorthand notation for \\(\\mathrm{Pr}(Y=y)\\) is \\(p(y)\\), and \\(p(\\cdot)\\) is called the probability mass function of \\(Y\\), and with two properties\n\n\\(0 \\leq p(y) \\leq 1\\) for all \\(y\\in\\mathcal{Y}\\),\n\\(\\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}} p(y) = 1\\).\n\n\nGeneral probability statements about \\(Y\\) can be derived from the pdf/pmf, for example, for any subset \\(A \\subseteq \\mathcal{Y}\\), we have \\(\\mathrm{Pr}(Y\\in A) = \\sum_{y\\in A} p(y)\\). When we have two disjoint subsets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) of \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\), we have \\[\\mathrm{Pr}(Y\\in A \\cup B) = \\mathrm{Pr}(Y\\in A) + \\mathrm{Pr}(Y\\in B)=\\sum_{y\\in A} p(y) + \\sum_{y\\in B} p(y).\\]\n\nLet \\(Y\\) be the number of successes in \\(n\\) independent Bernoulli trials, each with probability of success \\(\\theta\\). Then, \\(Y\\) follows a Binomial distribution with parameters \\(n\\) and \\(\\theta\\), denoted as \\(Y \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n,p)\\). The probability mass function of \\(Y\\) is given by \\[\np(y) = \\mathrm{Pr}(Y=y) = \\binom{n}{y} \\theta^y (1-\\theta)^{n-y}, \\quad y=0,1,2,\\dots,n.\n\\] If \\(\\theta=0.3\\) and \\(n=3\\), then the probability of observing exactly 2 successes is \\[\np(2) = \\mathrm{Pr}(Y=2 \\mid \\theta=0.3) = \\binom{3}{2\n} (0.3)^2 (0.7)^{1} = 3 \\cdot 0.09 \\cdot 0.7 = 0.189.\n\\]\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Continuous random variables\nIf \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) is uncountable, for example, \\(\\mathcal{Y} = \\mathbb{R}\\) or \\(\\mathcal{Y} = (0,1)\\), then \\(Y\\) is a continuous random variable. In this case, we cannot list all possible values of \\(Y\\) and assign probabilities to each value. Instead, we use a probability distribution to describe the distribution of \\(Y\\). That is, the cummulative distribution function (cdf) defined as follows.\n\nThe cumulative distribution function (cdf) of a continuous random variable \\(Y\\) is defined as \\[\nF(y) = \\mathrm{Pr}(Y \\leq y), \\quad y \\in \\mathcal{Y}.\n\\]\n\nNote that, for the cdf \\(F(y)\\), we have the following properties:\n\n\\(0 \\leq F(y) \\leq 1\\) for all \\(y\\in\\mathcal{Y}\\),\n\\(F(y)\\) is non-decreasing, meaning that if \\(y_1 &lt; y_2\\), then \\(F(y_1) \\leq F(y_2)\\),\n\\(\\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} F(y) = 0\\)\n\\(\\lim_{y \\to \\infty} F(y) = 1\\).\n\nProbability of various events can be derived from the cdf. For example, for any interval \\(A = (a,b] \\subseteq \\mathcal{Y}\\), we have \\[\n\\mathrm{Pr}(Y \\in A) = \\mathrm{Pr}(a &lt; Y \\leq b) =\nF(b) - F(a).\n\\] Also, \\(\\mathrm{Pr}(Y \\leq a) = F(a)\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Pr}(Y &gt; a) = 1 - F(a)\\).\n\n\n2.4.3 Description of distributions through quantiles and moments\nIn this subsection, we discuss a few ways to describe probability distributions: quantiles and moments. They are used to describe the behaviour of the distribution compressing them into summary statistics.\n\nThe expectation or mean of a random variable \\(Y\\) can be thought as the centre of mass or the location of the distribution, which is defined as\n\nFor discrete random variable: \\[\nE(Y) = \\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}} y p(y).\n\\]\nFor continuous random variable: \\[\nE(Y) = \\int_{\\mathcal{Y}} y f(y) dy.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDifference between mean, mode and median\n\n\n\n\nMean: the centre of mass of the distribution\nMode: The most probable value of \\(Y\\)\nMedian: The value of Y in the middle of the distribution.\n\n\n\nIn skewed distribution, the three will not equal to each other.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# -----------------------------\n# Theoretical reference lines\n# -----------------------------\nlines_normal &lt;- data.frame(\n  value = c(0, 0, 0),\n  Statistic = c(\"Mean\", \"Median\", \"Mode\")\n)\n\nlines_lognormal &lt;- data.frame(\n  value = c(exp(1/8), 1, exp(-1/4)),\n  Statistic = c(\"Mean\", \"Median\", \"Mode\")\n)\n\ncols &lt;- c(\"Mean\" = \"red\", \"Median\" = \"darkgreen\", \"Mode\" = \"purple\")\n\n# -----------------------------\n# Normal distribution\n# -----------------------------\np1 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  stat_function(fun = dnorm, size = 1, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_vline(\n    data = lines_normal,\n    aes(xintercept = value, color = Statistic),\n    linetype = \"dashed\",\n    size = 1\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = cols) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-4, 4)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Non-skewed Distribution (Normal)\",\n    x = \"Value\", y = \"Density\", color = \"Statistic\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# -----------------------------\n# Log-normal distribution: LN(0, 0.5)\n# -----------------------------\np2 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  stat_function(\n    fun = function(x) dlnorm(x, meanlog = 0, sdlog = 0.5),\n    size = 1,\n    color = \"black\"\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(\n    data = lines_lognormal,\n    aes(xintercept = value, color = Statistic),\n    linetype = \"dashed\",\n    size = 1\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = cols) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 8)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Skewed Distribution (Log-normal)\",\n    x = \"Value\", y = \"Density\", color = \"Statistic\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\np1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWhy use mean?\n\n\n\nThe mean is widely used in statistics and data analysis for several reasons:\n\nMathematical properties: The mean has desirable mathematical properties, such as linearity, which makes it easier to work with in various statistical analyses and models.\nSensitivity to all values: The mean takes into account all values in the dataset, providing a comprehensive measure of central tendency. It is also a scaled version of the total, which is often an interest\nFoundation for other statistical measures: The mean serves as the basis for many other statistical measures, such as variance and standard deviation, which are essential for understanding the spread and variability of data.\nMean minimizes the sum of squared deviations: The mean is the value that minimizes the sum of squared deviations (i.e., the expected penalty by choosing one value) from itself, making it a natural choice for summarizing data.\nMay contains full information: In some distributions (e.g., bernoulli distribution), the mean contains all the information about the distribution, making it a sufficient statistic for inference.\n\n\n\n\nThe variance of a random variable \\(Y\\) measures the spread or dispersion of the distribution, and is defined as \\[\n\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = E\\left[(Y - E(Y))^2\\right] = E[Y^2]- E^2[Y].\n\\] The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, denoted as \\(\\mathrm{SD}(Y) = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(Y)}\\).\n\n\nThe quantile of order \\(\\alpha\\) of a random variable \\(Y\\) is defined as the value \\(y_\\alpha\\) such that \\[\n\\mathrm{Pr}(Y \\leq y_\\alpha) = F(y_\\alpha) = \\alpha\n\\] for \\(0 &lt; \\alpha &lt; 1\\).\n\nFor example, the median is the quantile of order 0.5, denoted as \\(y_{0.5}\\), which satisfies \\(\\mathrm{Pr}(Y \\leq y_{0.5}) = 0.5\\). Also, \\((y_{0.025},y_{0.975})\\) and \\((y_{0.25},y_{0.75})\\) contains 95% and 50% of the mass of the distribution, respectively.",

The joint distribution of \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) describes the probability of various combinations of values that \\((Y_1,Y_2)\\) can take. We again work with the cumulative distribution function (cdf). The definition is given as follows.\n\nGiven a continuous joint cdf \\(F_{Y_1 Y_2}(y_1,y_2)\\), there is a function \\(p_{Y_1,Y_2}\\) such that \\[\nF_{Y_1,Y_2}(a,b) = \\int_{-\\infty}^a \\int_{-\\infty}^b p_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2) dy_2 dy_1,\n\\] and \\(p_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2)\\) is called the joint density function of \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\).\n\nSimilar to the discrete case, we can derive marginal and conditional densities from the joint density as\n\nMarginal density of \\(Y_1\\): \\[\np_{Y_1}(y_1) = \\int_{\\mathcal{Y}_2} p_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2) dy_2,\n\\]\nConditional density of \\(Y_2\\) given \\(\\{Y_1=y_1\\}\\): \\[\np_{Y_2 \\mid Y_1}(y_2 \\mid y_1) = \\frac{p_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2)}{p_{Y_1}(y_1)}.\n\\]\n\nThink about why \\(p_{Y_2 \\mid Y_1}(y_2 \\mid y_1)\\) is an actual pdf.\n\n\n2.5.3 Mixed continuous and discrete variables\nIt is possible to have joint distributions involving both discrete and continuous random variables. For example, let \\(Y_1\\) be a discrete random variable taking values in \\(\\mathcal{Y}_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) be a continuous random variable taking values in \\(\\mathcal{Y}_2\\). The joint distribution of \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) can be described by the joint density function \\(p_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2)\\), which gives the probability that \\(Y_1\\) takes the value \\(y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) takes a value in an infinitesimal interval around \\(y_2\\). One such as example is that \\(Y_1\\) is a binary variable indicating the presence or absence of a disease, and \\(Y_2\\) is a continuous variable representing the severity of symptoms. Suppose we define\n\nMarginal density \\(p_{Y_1}\\) from our belief \\(\\mathrm{Pr}(Y_1=y_1)\\)\na conditional density \\(p_{Y_2\\mid Y_1}\\) from \\(\\mathrm{Pr}(Y_2\\le y_2\\mid Y_1=y_1)\\doteq F_{Y_2\\mid Y_1}(y_2\\mid y_1)\\).\n\nThen, the joint density can be derived as \\[\np_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2) = p_{Y_1}(y_1) p_{Y_2 \\mid Y_1}(y_2 \\mid y_1),\n\\] and the probability can be calculated as \\[\n\\mathrm{Pr}(Y_1\\in A,Y_2\\in B) = \\int_{y_2\\in B} \\left\\{\\sum_{y_1\\in A}p_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2)\\right\\}dy_2.\n\\]\n\n\n2.5.4 Bayes’ rule and parameter estimation\nLet\n\n\\(\\theta\\): proportion of people in a large population who have a certain charactersitic.\n\\(Y\\): number of people in a small random sample from the population who have the charactersitic\n\nThen, in this case, we may threat \\(\\theta\\) as continuous random variable taking values in \\(\\Theta = (0,1)\\), and \\(Y\\) as a discrete random variable taking values in \\(\\mathcal{Y}= \\{0,1,2,\\dots,n\\}\\), where \\(n\\) is the sample size. Bayesian estimation of the parameter \\(\\theta\\) derives from the calculate of \\(p(\\theta\\mid y)\\) where \\(y\\) is the observed value of \\(Y\\). In Bayesian, this calculation first requires that we have a joint density \\(p(y,\\theta)\\) representing our belief about \\(\\theta\\) and the survey outcome \\(Y\\). Often, it is natural to construct this joint density from\n\n\\(p(\\theta)\\): our prior belief about \\(\\theta\\) before seeing the data, and\n\\(p(y \\mid \\theta)\\): belief about \\(Y\\) given \\(\\theta\\), often called the likelihood function.\n\nOnce we observed \\(\\{Y=y\\}\\), we need to compute our updated belief about \\(\\theta\\), represented by the posterior density \\(p(\\theta \\mid y)\\) as \\[\np(\\theta \\mid y) = \\frac{p(\\theta,y)}{p(y)} = \\frac{p(y \\mid \\theta) p(\\theta)}{p(y)} = \\frac{p(y \\mid \\theta) p(\\theta)}{\\int_{\\Theta} p(y \\mid \\theta) p(\\theta) d\\theta}.\n\\]\nIf we have two values \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) in \\(\\Theta\\) that may be true, then the ratio of their posterior densities is given by\n\\[\n\\frac{p(\\theta_1 \\mid y)}{p(\\theta_2 \\mid y)} = \\frac{p(y \\mid \\theta_1) p(\\theta_1) / p(y)}{p(y \\mid \\theta_2) p(\\theta_2) / p(y)} =\n\\frac{p(y \\mid \\theta_1) p(\\theta_1)}{p(y \\mid \\theta_2) p(\\theta_2)}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNote\n\n\n\nFrom this calculation, we notice when we are calculating the relative posterior probability between two parameter values we do not need calculate \\(p(y)\\) out.\n\n\nAnother way to think about this is, for a function of \\(\\theta\\), \\[\np(\\theta \\mid y) \\propto p(y \\mid \\theta) p(\\theta).\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNote\n\n\n\nWe will see that the numerator is the important part, while the denominator is just a normalizing constant to make sure the posterior density integrates to 1.",

    "text": "3.2 Happiness Data – the first example of Bayesian inference procedure\nWe study Bayesian inference for a binomial proportion \\(\\theta\\) when the sample size \\(n\\) is fixed. In this example, we want to see what is the procedure of doing Bayesian inference\n\nIn the 1998 General Social Survey, each female respondent aged 65 or over was asked whether she was generally happy.\nDefine the response variable \\[\nY_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if respondent } i \\text{ reports being generally happy},\\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise},\n\\end{cases}\n\\qquad i = 1,\\ldots,n,\n\\] where \\(n = 129\\).\nBecause we lack information that distinguishes individuals, it is reasonable to treat the responses as exchangeable.\nThat is, before observing the data, the labels or ordering of respondents carry no information.\nSince the sample size \\(n\\) is small relative to the population size \\(N\\) of senior women, results from the previous chapter justify the following modeling approximation.\nModeling Assumptions: Our beliefs about \\((Y_1,\\ldots,Y_{129})\\) are described by:\n\nAn unknown population proportion \\[\n\\theta = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i,\n\\] where \\(\\theta\\) represents the proportion of generally happy individuals in the population.\nA sampling model given \\(\\theta\\)\nConditional on \\(\\theta\\), the responses \\(Y_1,\\ldots,Y_{129}\\) are independent and identically distributed Bernoulli random variables with \\[\n\\Pr(Y_i = 1 \\mid \\theta) = \\theta.\n\\]\n\n\nGiven the population proportion \\(\\theta\\), each respondent independently reports being happy with probability \\(\\theta\\).\n\nLikelihood: Under this model, the probability of observing data \\(\\{y_1,\\ldots,y_{129}\\}\\) given \\(\\theta\\) is \\[\np(y_1,\\ldots,y_{129} \\mid \\theta)\n=\n\\theta^{\\sum_{i=1}^{129} y_i}\n(1-\\theta)^{129-\\sum_{i=1}^{129} y_i}.\n\\]\nThis expression depends on the data only through the sufficient statistic \\[\nS = \\sum_{i=1}^{129} Y_i,\n\\] the total number of respondents who report being generally happy.\nFor the happiness data, \\[\nS = 118,\n\\] so the likelihood simplifies to \\[\np(y_1,\\ldots,y_{129} \\mid \\theta)\n=\n\\theta^{118}(1-\\theta)^{11}.\n\\]\nQ: Which prior to be used?\nA prior distribution is conjugate to a likelihood if the posterior distribution belongs to the same family as the prior. For the binomial likelihood, the Beta distribution is conjugate. But we have another choice of prior, to use non-informative prior.\nA Uniform Prior Distribution: Suppose our prior information about \\(\\theta\\) is very weak, in the sense that all subintervals of \\([0,1]\\) with equal length are equally plausible.\nSymbolically, for any \\(0 \\le a &lt; b &lt; b+c \\le 1\\), \\[\n\\Pr(a \\le \\theta \\le b)\n=\n\\Pr(a+c \\le \\theta \\le b+c).\n\\]\nThis implies a uniform prior: \\[\np(\\theta) = 1, \\qquad 0 \\le \\theta \\le 1.\n\\]\nPosterior Distribution: Bayes’ rule gives \\[\np(\\theta \\mid y_1,\\ldots,y_{129})\n=\n\\frac{p(y_1,\\ldots,y_{129} \\mid \\theta)\\,p(\\theta)}\n     {p(y_1,\\ldots,y_{129})}.\n\\]\nWith a uniform prior, this reduces to \\[\np(\\theta \\mid y_1,\\ldots,y_{129})\n\\propto\n\\theta^{118}(1-\\theta)^{11}.\n\\]\n\nKey idea: with a uniform prior, the posterior has the same shape as the likelihood.\n\nTo obtain a proper probability distribution, we must normalize.\nNormalizing Constant and the Beta Distribution: Using the identity \\[\n\\int_0^1 \\theta^{a-1}(1-\\theta)^{b-1}\\,d\\theta\n=\n\\frac{\\Gamma(a)\\Gamma(b)}{\\Gamma(a+b)},\n\\] we find \\[\np(y_1,\\ldots,y_{129})\n=\n\\frac{\\Gamma(119)\\Gamma(12)}{\\Gamma(131)}.\n\\]\nTherefore, the posterior density is \\[\np(\\theta \\mid y_1,\\ldots,y_{129})\n=\n\\frac{\\Gamma(131)}{\\Gamma(119)\\Gamma(12)}\n\\theta^{119-1}(1-\\theta)^{12-1}.\n\\]\nThat is, \\[\n\\theta \\mid y \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(119,\\,12).\n\\]\nRecall that, a random variable \\(\\theta \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(a,b)\\) distribution if \\[\np(\\theta)\n=\n\\frac{\\Gamma(a+b)}{\\Gamma(a)\\Gamma(b)}\n\\theta^{a-1}(1-\\theta)^{b-1}.\n\\]\nFor \\(\\theta \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(a,b)\\), the expectation (i.e., mean or the first moment) is \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\theta) = \\frac{a}{a+b}\\), and the variance is \\(\\mathrm{Var}(\\theta)=\\frac{ab}{(a+b)^2(a+b+1)}.\\)\nIn our example, the happiness data, the posterior distribution is \\[\n\\theta \\mid y \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(119,12).\n\\]\nThus, the posterior mean is \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\theta \\mid y) = 0.915\\), and the posterior standard deviation is \\(\\mathrm{sd}(\\theta \\mid y) = 0.025\\).\nThese summaries quantify both our best estimate of the population proportion and our remaining uncertainty after observing the data.\n\n\n3.2.1 Inference about exchangeable binary data\nPosterior Inference under a Uniform Prior\nSuppose \\(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n \\mid \\theta \\stackrel{\\text{i.i.d.}}{\\sim} \\text{Bernoulli}(\\theta)\\), and we place a uniform prior on \\(\\theta\\). The posterior distribution of \\(\\theta\\) given the observed data \\(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\) is proportional to \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np(\\theta \\mid y_1, \\ldots, y_n)\n&= \\frac{p(y_1, \\ldots, y_n \\mid \\theta) p(\\theta)}{p(y_1, \\ldots, y_n)} \\\\\n&= \\theta^{\\sum_i y_i}(1 - \\theta)^{n - \\sum_i y_i} \\times \\frac{p(\\theta)}{p(y_1, \\ldots, y_n)}\\\\\n&\\propto\n\\theta^{\\sum_i y_i}(1 - \\theta)^{n - \\sum_i y_i}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nConsider two parameter values \\(\\theta_a\\) and \\(\\theta_b\\). The ratio of their posterior densities is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{p(\\theta_a \\mid y_1, \\ldots, y_n)}\n     {p(\\theta_b \\mid y_1, \\ldots, y_n)}\n&=\\frac{\\theta_a^{\\sum y_i}\\left(1-\\theta_a\\right)^{n-\\sum y_i} \\times p\\left(\\theta_a\\right) / p\\left(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\right)}{\\theta_b^{\\sum y_i}\\left(1-\\theta_b\\right)^{n-\\sum y_i} \\times p\\left(\\theta_b\\right) / p\\left(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\right)} \\\\\n&=\n\\left(\\frac{\\theta_a}{\\theta_b}\\right)^{\\sum_i y_i}\n\\left(\\frac{1 - \\theta_a}{1 - \\theta_b}\\right)^{n - \\sum_i y_i}\n\\frac{p(\\theta_a)}{p(\\theta_b)}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis expression shows that the data affect the posterior distribution only through the sum of the data \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\\) based on the relative probability density at \\(\\theta_a\\) to \\(\\theta_b\\).\nAs a result, for any set \\(A\\), one can show that \\[\n\\Pr(\\theta \\in A \\mid Y_1 = y_1, \\ldots, Y_n = y_n)\n=\n\\Pr\\left(\\theta \\in A \\mid \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i = \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\\right).\n\\]\nThis means that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\\) contains all the information in the data relevant for inference about \\(\\theta\\). We therefore say that \\(Y = \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\\) is a sufficient statistic for \\(\\theta\\). The term sufficient is used because knowing \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\\) is sufficient to carry out inference about \\(\\theta\\); no additional information from the individual observations \\(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n\\) is required.\nIn the case where \\(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n \\mid \\theta\\) are i.i.d. Bernoulli\\((\\theta)\\) random variables, the sufficient statistic \\(Y = \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\\) follows a binomial distribution with parameters \\((n, \\theta)\\).\nThe Binomial Model\nBecause each \\(Y_i\\) is Bernoulli\\((\\theta)\\) and the observations are independent, the sufficient statistic \\(Y = \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\\) follows a binomial distribution with parameters \\((n, \\theta)\\).\nThat is, \\(\\Pr(Y = y \\mid \\theta)=\\binom{n}{y} \\theta^y (1 - \\theta)^{n - y}\\), \\(y = 0, 1, \\ldots, n\\). For a binomial\\((n, \\theta)\\) random variable \\(Y\\),\n\n\\(\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid \\theta] = n\\theta\\),\n\\(\\mathrm{Var}(Y \\mid \\theta) = n\\theta(1 - \\theta).\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosterior inference under a uniform prior distribution\nHaving observed \\(Y = y\\) our task is to obtain the posterior distribution of \\(\\theta\\). By Bayes’ theorem, \\[\np(\\theta \\mid y)\n= \\frac{p(y \\mid \\theta),p(\\theta)}{p(y)}.\n\\]\nFor a binomial model with \\(Y \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n,\\theta)\\), the likelihood is \\[\np(y \\mid \\theta) = \\binom{n}{y}\\theta^y(1-\\theta)^{n-y}.\n\\]\nTherefore, \\[\np(\\theta \\mid y)\n= \\frac{\\binom{n}{y} \\theta^y(1-\\theta)^{n-y}p(\\theta)}{p(y)}\n= c(y) \\theta^y(1-\\theta)^{n-y}\\pi(\\theta),\n\\] where \\(c(y)\\) is a normalizing constant that depends only on \\(y\\), not on \\(\\theta\\). When using the uniform distribution, \\(\\pi(\\theta)\\), we can calculate \\(c(y)\\) easily as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n1&=\\int_0^1 c(y) \\theta^y(1-\\theta)^{n-y} d \\theta \\\\\n&=c(y) \\int_0^1 \\theta^y(1-\\theta)^{n-y} d \\theta \\\\\n&=c(y) \\frac{\\Gamma(y+1) \\Gamma(n-y+1)}{\\Gamma(n+2)}\n\\end{aligned}.\n\\] Hence, \\(c(y)=\\Gamma(n+2)/\\{\\Gamma(y+1) \\Gamma(n-y+1)\\}\\), and the posterior distribution is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np(\\theta \\mid y) & =\\frac{\\Gamma(n+2)}{\\Gamma(y+1) \\Gamma(n-y+1)} \\theta^y(1-\\theta)^{n-y} \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\Gamma(n+2)}{\\Gamma(y+1) \\Gamma(n-y+1)} \\theta^{(y+1)-1}(1-\\theta)^{(n-y+1)-1},\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Which is exactly the \\(\\operatorname{beta}(y+1, n-y+1)\\). In the happiness example, we have \\(n=129\\) and \\(Y=\\sum Y_i=118\\), so the posterior distribution is \\(\\operatorname{beta}(119,12)\\), written as \\[\nn=129, Y \\equiv \\sum Y_i=118 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\theta \\mid\\{Y=118\\} \\sim \\operatorname{beta}(119,12) .\n\\]\nThis confirms the sufficiency result for this model and prior distribution, by showing that if \\(\\sum y_i = y = 118\\), \\(p(\\theta\\mid  y_1,\\dots y_n) = p(\\theta\\mid y) = \\mathrm{beta}(119, 12)\\). That is, the information contained in \\(\\{Y_1 = y_1, \\dots, Y_n = y_n\\}\\) is the same as the information contained in \\(\\{Y = y\\}\\), where \\(Y = \\sum Y_i\\) and \\(y = \\sum y_i\\). This show the posterior when we use uniform prior. One may ask, what if we use a different prior?\nPosterior distributions under beta prior distributions\nThe uniform prior distribution has \\(\\pi(\\theta) = 1\\) for all \\(\\theta\\in [0,1]\\). This distribution can be thought of as a beta prior distribution with parameters \\(a = 1, b = 1\\) \\[\np(\\theta)=\\frac{\\Gamma(2)}{\\Gamma(1) \\Gamma(1)} \\theta^{1-1}(1-\\theta)^{1-1}=\\frac{1}{1 \\times 1} 1 \\times 1=1\n\\] for all \\(\\theta \\in[0,1]\\).\n\nThe gamma function is defined as \\[\n\\Gamma(x)=\\int_0^{\\infty} t^{x-1} e^{-t} d t, \\quad x&gt;0.\n\\]\nIt satisfies the following properties:\n\n\\(\\Gamma(n)=(n-1)!\\) for any positive integer \\(n\\).\n\\(\\Gamma(x+1)=x \\Gamma(x)\\) for any \\(x&gt;0\\).\n\\(\\Gamma(1 / 2)=\\sqrt{\\pi}\\).\n\\(\\Gamma(1)=1\\) by convention.\n\n\nNow, from the previous part, recall that we have, \\[\n\\text { if }\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}\n\\theta \\sim \\operatorname{beta}(1,1) \\text { (uniform) } \\\\\nY \\sim \\operatorname{binomial}(n, \\theta)\n\\end{array}\\right\\}, \\text { then }\\{\\theta \\mid Y=y\\} \\sim \\operatorname{beta}(1+y, 1+n-y).\n\\]\nTo get the posterior distribution under a general beta prior distribution, we just need to add the number of 1’s to the \\(\\alpha\\) parameter and the number of 0’s to the \\(\\beta\\) parameter. To see this, assume \\(\\theta\\sim \\operatorname{beta}(\\alpha, \\beta)\\), and \\(Y\\mid \\theta \\sim \\operatorname{binomial}(n, \\theta)\\). Then, once we observed \\(\\{Y=y\\}\\), by Bayes’ theorem, the posterior distribution is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np(\\theta \\mid y) & =\\frac{p(\\theta) p(y \\mid \\theta)}{p(y)} \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{p(y)} \\times \\frac{\\Gamma(a+b)}{\\Gamma(a) \\Gamma(b)} \\theta^{a-1}(1-\\theta)^{b-1} \\times\\binom{ n}{y} \\theta^y(1-\\theta)^{n-y} \\\\\n& =c(n, y, a, b) \\times \\theta^{a+y-1}(1-\\theta)^{b+n-y-1} \\\\\n&\\propto beta(a+y, b+n-y) .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteOne-to-one correspondence between the distribution\n\n\n\nNote that, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the prior distribution parameters and the posterior distribution parameters. Two distributions are said to be the same if\n\nTheir CDFs are the same.\nTheir PDFs are the same.\nAll of their moments are the same. This implies that they are equal if and only if the moment generating function or the probability generating functions are the same.\n\n\n\nWe have seen the beta-binomial example twice, which is an example of conjugate prior, let’s definite this formally,\n\nA class \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) of prior distribution for \\(\\theta\\) is said conjugate for the likelihood function \\(p(y \\mid \\theta)\\) if for every prior distribution \\(\\pi(\\theta) \\in \\mathcal{P}\\), the corresponding posterior distribution \\(p(\\theta \\mid y)\\) is also in \\(\\mathcal{P}\\), that is \\[\n\\pi(\\theta) \\in \\mathcal{P} \\Rightarrow p(\\theta \\mid y) \\in \\mathcal{P}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nConjugate priors simplify posterior calculations, but they may not accurately reflect genuine prior beliefs. Still, mixtures of conjugate priors offer substantially greater flexibility while remaining computationally tractable.\n\n\nIf the likelihood \\(\\theta \\mid \\{Y = y\\} \\sim beta(a + y, b + n − y)\\), recall that \\[\n\\mathrm{E}[\\theta \\mid y]=\\frac{a+y}{a+b+n}, \\operatorname{mode}[\\theta \\mid y]=\\frac{a+y-1}{a+b+n-2}, \\operatorname{Var}[\\theta \\mid y]=\\frac{\\mathrm{E}[\\theta \\mid y] \\mathrm{E}[1-\\theta \\mid y]}{a+b+n+1} .\n\\]\nThe posterior mean can be expressed as a weighted average of the prior mean and the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of \\(\\theta\\): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{E}[\\theta \\mid y] & =\\frac{a+y}{a+b+n} \\\\\n& =\\frac{a+b}{a+b+n} \\times\\frac{a}{a+b}+\\frac{n}{a+b+n}\\times \\frac{y}{n} \\\\\n& =\\frac{a+b}{a+b+n} \\times \\text { prior expectation }+\\frac{n}{a+b+n} \\times \\text { data mean }\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] For this model and prior distribution, the posterior expectation (also known as the posterior mean) can be expressed as a weighted average of the prior expectation and the sample mean. The weights are proportional to the prior sample size a + b and the observed sample size n, respectively. This representation leads to a natural interpretation of the Beta prior parameters as prior data:\n\n\\(a \\approx \\text{``prior \\# of 1’s,''}\\)\n\\(b \\approx \\text{``prior \\# of 0’s,''}\\)\n\\(a + b \\approx \\text{``prior sample size.''}\\)\n\nWhen \\(n \\gg a+b\\), it is reasonable to expect that most of the information about \\(\\theta\\) should come from the data rather than from the prior distribution. This intuition is confirmed mathematically. In particular, when \\(n \\gg a + b\\),\n\n\\(\\frac{a + b}{a + b + n} \\approx 0\\),\n\\(\\mathbb{E}[\\theta \\mid y] \\approx \\frac{y}{n}\\),\n\\(\\mathrm{Var}(\\theta \\mid y) \\approx \\frac{1}{n}\\,\\frac{y}{n}\\left(1 - \\frac{y}{n}\\right)\\).\n\nThus, in large samples, the posterior mean approaches the sample proportion and the posterior variance shrinks at rate \\(1/n\\), reflecting increasing information from the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrediction\nAn important feature of Bayesian inference is the existence of a predictive distribution for new observations.\n\nThe posterior predictive distribution for a new observation \\(Y_{\\text{new}}\\) given the observed data \\(y\\) is obtained by integrating over the posterior distribution of \\(\\theta\\).\n\nReturning to our notation for binary data, let\n\\(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\) be the observed outcomes from a sample of \\(n\\) binary rvs, and let\n\\(\\tilde Y \\in \\{0,1\\}\\) denote a future observation from the same population that has not yet been observed. The predictive distribution of \\(\\tilde Y\\) is defined as the conditional distribution of \\(\\tilde Y\\) given the observed data \\(\\{Y_1=y_1,\\ldots,Y_n=y_n\\}\\). For conditionally i.i.d. binary observations, the predictive distribution can be derived by integrating out the unknown parameter \\(\\theta\\): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(\\tilde{Y}=1 \\mid y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\right) & =\\int \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(\\tilde{Y}=1, \\theta \\mid y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\right) d \\theta \\\\\n& =\\int \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(\\tilde{Y}=1 \\mid \\theta, y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\right) p\\left(\\theta \\mid y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\right) d \\theta \\\\\n& =\\int  p\\left(\\theta \\mid y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\right) \\theta d \\theta \\\\\n& =\\mathrm{E}\\left[\\theta \\mid y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\right]\\\\\n&=\\frac{a+\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i}{a+b+n}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nHence, we also have, \\[\n\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(\\tilde{Y}=0 \\mid y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\right)  =1-\\mathrm{E}\\left[\\theta \\mid y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\right]=\\frac{b+\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(1-y_i\\right)}{a+b+n} .\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteProperties of the predictive distribution\n\n\n\n\nIt does not depend on any unknown quantities. If it did, it could not be used to make predictions.\nIt depends on the observed data. In particular, \\(\\tilde Y\\) is not independent of \\(Y_1,\\ldots,Y_n\\), because the observed data provide information about \\(\\theta\\), which in turn influences \\(\\tilde Y\\). If \\(\\tilde Y\\) were independent of the observed data, learning from data would be impossible.\n\n\n\n\nThe uniform prior distribution on [0,1], also known as the (1,1) prior, can be interpreted as containing the same information as a hypothetical prior dataset consisting of one success (“1”) and one failure (“0”).\nUnder this prior, the posterior predictive probability of a future success is \\[\n\\Pr(\\tilde Y = 1 \\mid Y = y)\n= \\mathbb{E}[\\theta \\mid Y = y]\n= \\frac{2}{2+n}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\n    •   \\frac{n}{2+n}\\cdot\\frac{y}{n}.\n\\]\nThis expression highlights that the predictive probability is a weighted average of: • the prior mean 1/2, and • the sample proportion y/n,\nwith weights proportional to the prior sample size 2 and the observed sample size n, respectively.\nThe posterior mode under this prior is \\[\n\\text{mode}(\\theta \\mid Y = y) = \\frac{y}{n},\n\\] where \\[\nY = \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i.\n\\]\nAt first glance, the discrepancy between these two posterior summaries may seem surprising. However, it reflects the fact that different summaries capture different features of the posterior distribution.\nTo see this clearly, consider the case Y = 0. In this case, \\[\n\\text{mode}(\\theta \\mid Y = 0) = 0,\n\\] but the predictive probability remains \\[\n\\Pr(\\tilde Y = 1 \\mid Y = 0) = \\frac{1}{2+n}.\n\\]\nThus, even when no successes have been observed, the Bayesian predictive distribution assigns a positive probability to a future success due to the prior information. This illustrates how Bayesian prediction naturally balances prior beliefs with observed data.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Confidence regions\n\nAn interval \\([\\ell(y), u(y)]\\), based on the observed data \\(Y = y\\), has 100(1-\\(\\alpha\\))% Bayesian coverage for \\(\\theta\\) if\n\\[\n\\Pr(\\ell(y) &lt; \\theta &lt; u(y)\\mid Y = y) = 1-\\alpha.\n\\]\n\n\nA random interval \\([\\ell(Y ), u(Y )]\\) has 100 (1-$)% frequentist coverage for \\(\\theta\\) if, before the data are gathered,\n\\[\n\\Pr(\\ell(Y ) &lt; \\theta &lt; u(Y )\\mid\\theta) = 1-\\alpha.\n\\]",

R can also be thought of as a high-level programming language. In fact, R is one of the top languages to be used by data analysts and data scientists. There are a lot of analysis packages in R that are currently developed and maintained by researchers around the world to deal with different data problems. Most importantly, R is free! In this section, we will learn how to use R to conduct basic statistical analyses.",
