Let {H1,H2,H3,H4} be the events that a randomly selected person in this sample is in, respectively, the lower 25th percentile, the second 25th percentile, the third 25th percentile and the upper 25th percentile in terms of income.

Let \\(E\\) be the event that a randomly sampled person from the survey has a college education. From the survey data, we have \\[\\{\\mathrm{Pr}(E\\mid H_1), \\mathrm{Pr}(E\\mid H_2),\\mathrm{Pr}(E\\mid H_3), \\mathrm{Pr}(E\\mid H_4)\\} = \\{.11, .19, .31, .53\\}.\\] These probabilities do not sum to 1 - they represent the proportions of people with college degrees in the four different income subpopulations \\(H_1, H_2, H_3\\) and \\(H_4\\). Now let’s consider the income distribution of the college-educated population. Using Bayes’ rule we can obtain\n\\(\\{\\mathrm{Pr}(H_1\\mid E), \\mathrm{Pr}(H_2\\mid E), \\mathrm{Pr}(H_3\\mid E), \\mathrm{Pr}(H_4 \\mid E)\\} = \\{0.09, 0.17, 0.27, 0.47\\} ,\\) and we see that the income distribution for people in the college-educated population differs markedly from \\(\\{0.25, 0.25,0.25,0.25\\}\\), the distribution for the general population. Note that these probabilities do sum to 1 - they are the conditional probabilities of the events in the partition, given \\(E\\).\n\nIn Bayesian inference, \\({H_1, . . . ,H_K}\\) often refer to disjoint hypotheses or states of nature and \\(E\\) refers to the outcome of a survey, study or experiment. To compare hypotheses post-experimentally, we often calculate the following ratio: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_i \\mid E\\right)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_j \\mid E\\right)} & =\\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(E \\mid H_i\\right) \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_i\\right) / \\operatorname{Pr}(E)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(E \\mid H_j\\right) \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_j\\right) / \\operatorname{Pr}(E)} \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(E \\mid H_i\\right) \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_i\\right)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(E \\mid H_j\\right) \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_j\\right)} \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(E \\mid H_i\\right)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(E \\mid H_j\\right)} \\times \\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_i\\right)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_j\\right)} \\\\\n& =\\text { \"Bayes factor\" × \"prior beliefs\". }\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] This calculation reminds us that Bayes’ rule does not determine what our beliefs should be after seeing the data, it only tells us how they should change after seeing the data.",

    "text": "2.4 Random Variables\nIn Bayesian inference a random variable is defined as an unknown numerical quantity about which we make probability statements. For example, the quantitative outcome of a survey, experiment or study is a random variable before the study is performed. Additionally, a fixed but unknown population parameter is also a random variable\n\n2.4.1 Discrete Ramdon variables\nLet \\(Y\\) be a random variable and let \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) be the set of all possible values that \\(Y\\) can take. If \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) is countable, meaning that \\(\\mathcal{Y} = \\{y_1,y_2,\\dots\\}\\), then \\(Y\\) is a discrete random variable.\n\nThe event that the outcome \\(Y\\) of our survey has the value \\(Y\\) is expressed as \\(\\{Y=y\\}\\). For each \\(y\\in\\mathcal{Y}\\), the shorthand notation for \\(\\mathrm{Pr}(Y=y)\\) is \\(p(y)\\), and \\(p(\\cdot)\\) is called the probability mass function of \\(Y\\), and with two properties\n\n\\(0 \\leq p(y) \\leq 1\\) for all \\(y\\in\\mathcal{Y}\\),\n\\(\\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}} p(y) = 1\\).\n\n\nGeneral probability statements about \\(Y\\) can be derived from the pdf/pmf, for example, for any subset \\(A \\subseteq \\mathcal{Y}\\), we have \\(\\mathrm{Pr}(Y\\in A) = \\sum_{y\\in A} p(y)\\). When we have two disjoint subsets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) of \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\), we have \\[\\mathrm{Pr}(Y\\in A \\cup B) = \\mathrm{Pr}(Y\\in A) + \\mathrm{Pr}(Y\\in B)=\\sum_{y\\in A} p(y) + \\sum_{y\\in B} p(y).\\]\n\nLet \\(Y\\) be the number of successes in \\(n\\) independent Bernoulli trials, each with probability of success \\(\\theta\\). Then, \\(Y\\) follows a Binomial distribution with parameters \\(n\\) and \\(\\theta\\), denoted as \\(Y \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n,p)\\). The probability mass function of \\(Y\\) is given by \\[\np(y) = \\mathrm{Pr}(Y=y) = \\binom{n}{y} \\theta^y (1-\\theta)^{n-y}, \\quad y=0,1,2,\\dots,n.\n\\] If \\(\\theta=0.3\\) and \\(n=3\\), then the probability of observing exactly 2 successes is \\[\np(2) = \\mathrm{Pr}(Y=2 \\mid \\theta=0.3) = \\binom{3}{2\n} (0.3)^2 (0.7)^{1} = 3 \\cdot 0.09 \\cdot 0.7 = 0.189.\n\\]\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Continuous random variables\nIf \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) is uncountable, for example, \\(\\mathcal{Y} = \\mathbb{R}\\) or \\(\\mathcal{Y} = (0,1)\\), then \\(Y\\) is a continuous random variable. In this case, we cannot list all possible values of \\(Y\\) and assign probabilities to each value. Instead, we use a probability distribution to describe the distribution of \\(Y\\). That is, the cummulative distribution function (cdf) defined as follows.\n\nThe cumulative distribution function (cdf) of a continuous random variable \\(Y\\) is defined as \\[\nF(y) = \\mathrm{Pr}(Y \\leq y), \\quad y \\in \\mathcal{Y}.\n\\]\n\nNote that, for the cdf \\(F(y)\\), we have the following properties:\n\n\\(0 \\leq F(y) \\leq 1\\) for all \\(y\\in\\mathcal{Y}\\),\n\\(F(y)\\) is non-decreasing, meaning that if \\(y_1 &lt; y_2\\), then \\(F(y_1) \\leq F(y_2)\\),\n\\(\\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} F(y) = 0\\)\n\\(\\lim_{y \\to \\infty} F(y) = 1\\).\n\nProbability of various events can be derived from the cdf. For example, for any interval \\(A = (a,b] \\subseteq \\mathcal{Y}\\), we have \\[\n\\mathrm{Pr}(Y \\in A) = \\mathrm{Pr}(a &lt; Y \\leq b) =\nF(b) - F(a).\n\\] Also, \\(\\mathrm{Pr}(Y \\leq a) = F(a)\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Pr}(Y &gt; a) = 1 - F(a)\\).\n\n\n2.4.3 Description of distributions through quantiles and moments\nIn this subsection, we discuss a few ways to describe probability distributions: quantiles and moments. They are used to describe the behaviour of the distribution compressing them into summary statistics.\n\nThe expectation or mean of a random variable \\(Y\\) can be thought as the centre of mass or the location of the distribution, which is defined as\n\nFor discrete random variable: \\[\nE(Y) = \\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}} y p(y).\n\\]\nFor continuous random variable: \\[\nE(Y) = \\int_{\\mathcal{Y}} y f(y) dy.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDifference between mean, mode and median\n\n\n\n\nMean: the centre of mass of the distribution\nMode: The most probable value of \\(Y\\)\nMedian: The value of Y in the middle of the distribution.\n\n\n\nIn skewed distribution, the three will not equal to each other.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# -----------------------------\n# Theoretical reference lines\n# -----------------------------\nlines_normal &lt;- data.frame(\n  value = c(0, 0, 0),\n  Statistic = c(\"Mean\", \"Median\", \"Mode\")\n)\n\nlines_lognormal &lt;- data.frame(\n  value = c(exp(1/8), 1, exp(-1/4)),\n  Statistic = c(\"Mean\", \"Median\", \"Mode\")\n)\n\ncols &lt;- c(\"Mean\" = \"red\", \"Median\" = \"darkgreen\", \"Mode\" = \"purple\")\n\n# -----------------------------\n# Normal distribution\n# -----------------------------\np1 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  stat_function(fun = dnorm, size = 1, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_vline(\n    data = lines_normal,\n    aes(xintercept = value, color = Statistic),\n    linetype = \"dashed\",\n    size = 1\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = cols) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-4, 4)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Non-skewed Distribution (Normal)\",\n    x = \"Value\", y = \"Density\", color = \"Statistic\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# -----------------------------\n# Log-normal distribution: LN(0, 0.5)\n# -----------------------------\np2 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  stat_function(\n    fun = function(x) dlnorm(x, meanlog = 0, sdlog = 0.5),\n    size = 1,\n    color = \"black\"\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(\n    data = lines_lognormal,\n    aes(xintercept = value, color = Statistic),\n    linetype = \"dashed\",\n    size = 1\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = cols) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 8)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Skewed Distribution (Log-normal)\",\n    x = \"Value\", y = \"Density\", color = \"Statistic\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\np1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWhy use mean?\n\n\n\nThe mean is widely used in statistics and data analysis for several reasons:\n\nMathematical properties: The mean has desirable mathematical properties, such as linearity, which makes it easier to work with in various statistical analyses and models.\nSensitivity to all values: The mean takes into account all values in the dataset, providing a comprehensive measure of central tendency. It is also a scaled version of the total, which is often an interest\nFoundation for other statistical measures: The mean serves as the basis for many other statistical measures, such as variance and standard deviation, which are essential for understanding the spread and variability of data.\nMean minimizes the sum of squared deviations: The mean is the value that minimizes the sum of squared deviations (i.e., the expected penalty by choosing one value) from itself, making it a natural choice for summarizing data.\nMay contains full information: In some distributions (e.g., bernoulli distribution), the mean contains all the information about the distribution, making it a sufficient statistic for inference.\n\n\n\n\nThe variance of a random variable \\(Y\\) measures the spread or dispersion of the distribution, and is defined as \\[\n\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = E\\left[(Y - E(Y))^2\\right] = E[Y^2]- E^2[Y].\n\\] The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, denoted as \\(\\mathrm{SD}(Y) = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(Y)}\\).\n\n\nThe quantile of order \\(\\alpha\\) of a random variable \\(Y\\) is defined as the value \\(y_\\alpha\\) such that \\[\n\\mathrm{Pr}(Y \\leq y_\\alpha) = F(y_\\alpha) = \\alpha\n\\] for \\(0 &lt; \\alpha &lt; 1\\).\n\nFor example, the median is the quantile of order 0.5, denoted as \\(y_{0.5}\\), which satisfies \\(\\mathrm{Pr}(Y \\leq y_{0.5}) = 0.5\\). Also, \\((y_{0.025},y_{0.975})\\) and \\((y_{0.25},y_{0.75})\\) contains 95% and 50% of the mass of the distribution, respectively.",

The joint distribution of \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) describes the probability of various combinations of values that \\((Y_1,Y_2)\\) can take. We again work with the cumulative distribution function (cdf). The definition is given as follows.\n\nGiven a continuous joint cdf \\(F_{Y_1 Y_2}(y_1,y_2)\\), there is a function \\(p_{Y_1,Y_2}\\) such that \\[\nF_{Y_1,Y_2}(a,b) = \\int_{-\\infty}^a \\int_{-\\infty}^b p_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2) dy_2 dy_1,\n\\] and \\(p_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2)\\) is called the joint density function of \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\).\n\nSimilar to the discrete case, we can derive marginal and conditional densities from the joint density as\n\nMarginal density of \\(Y_1\\): \\[\np_{Y_1}(y_1) = \\int_{\\mathcal{Y}_2} p_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2) dy_2,\n\\]\nConditional density of \\(Y_2\\) given \\(\\{Y_1=y_1\\}\\): \\[\np_{Y_2 \\mid Y_1}(y_2 \\mid y_1) = \\frac{p_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2)}{p_{Y_1}(y_1)}.\n\\]\n\nThink about why \\(p_{Y_2 \\mid Y_1}(y_2 \\mid y_1)\\) is an actual pdf.\n\n\n2.5.3 Mixed continuous and discrete variables\nIt is possible to have joint distributions involving both discrete and continuous random variables. For example, let \\(Y_1\\) be a discrete random variable taking values in \\(\\mathcal{Y}_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) be a continuous random variable taking values in \\(\\mathcal{Y}_2\\). The joint distribution of \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) can be described by the joint density function \\(p_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2)\\), which gives the probability that \\(Y_1\\) takes the value \\(y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) takes a value in an infinitesimal interval around \\(y_2\\). One such as example is that \\(Y_1\\) is a binary variable indicating the presence or absence of a disease, and \\(Y_2\\) is a continuous variable representing the severity of symptoms. Suppose we define\n\nMarginal density \\(p_{Y_1}\\) from our belief \\(\\mathrm{Pr}(Y_1=y_1)\\)\na conditional density \\(p_{Y_2\\mid Y_1}\\) from \\(\\mathrm{Pr}(Y_2\\le y_2\\mid Y_1=y_1)\\doteq F_{Y_2\\mid Y_1}(y_2\\mid y_1)\\).\n\nThen, the joint density can be derived as \\[\np_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2) = p_{Y_1}(y_1) p_{Y_2 \\mid Y_1}(y_2 \\mid y_1),\n\\] and the probability can be calculated as \\[\n\\mathrm{Pr}(Y_1\\in A,Y_2\\in B) = \\int_{y_2\\in B} \\left\\{\\sum_{y_1\\in A}p_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2)\\right\\}dy_2.\n\\]\n\n\n2.5.4 Bayes’ rule and parameter estimation\nLet\n\n\\(\\theta\\): proportion of people in a large population who have a certain charactersitic.\n\\(Y\\): number of people in a small random sample from the population who have the charactersitic\n\nThen, in this case, we may threat \\(\\theta\\) as continuous random variable taking values in \\(\\Theta = (0,1)\\), and \\(Y\\) as a discrete random variable taking values in \\(\\mathcal{Y}= \\{0,1,2,\\dots,n\\}\\), where \\(n\\) is the sample size. Bayesian estimation of the parameter \\(\\theta\\) derives from the calculate of \\(p(\\theta\\mid y)\\) where \\(y\\) is the observed value of \\(Y\\). In Bayesian, this calculation first requires that we have a joint density \\(p(y,\\theta)\\) representing our belief about \\(\\theta\\) and the survey outcome \\(Y\\). Often, it is natural to construct this joint density from\n\n\\(p(\\theta)\\): our prior belief about \\(\\theta\\) before seeing the data, and\n\\(p(y \\mid \\theta)\\): belief about \\(Y\\) given \\(\\theta\\), often called the likelihood function.\n\nOnce we observed \\(\\{Y=y\\}\\), we need to compute our updated belief about \\(\\theta\\), represented by the posterior density \\(p(\\theta \\mid y)\\) as \\[\np(\\theta \\mid y) = \\frac{p(\\theta,y)}{p(y)} = \\frac{p(y \\mid \\theta) p(\\theta)}{p(y)} = \\frac{p(y \\mid \\theta) p(\\theta)}{\\int_{\\Theta} p(y \\mid \\theta) p(\\theta) d\\theta}.\n\\]\nIf we have two values \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) in \\(\\Theta\\) that may be true, then the ratio of their posterior densities is given by\n\\[\n\\frac{p(\\theta_1 \\mid y)}{p(\\theta_2 \\mid y)} = \\frac{p(y \\mid \\theta_1) p(\\theta_1) / p(y)}{p(y \\mid \\theta_2) p(\\theta_2) / p(y)} =\n\\frac{p(y \\mid \\theta_1) p(\\theta_1)}{p(y \\mid \\theta_2) p(\\theta_2)}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNote\n\n\n\nFrom this calculation, we notice when we are calculating the relative posterior probability between two parameter values we do not need calculate \\(p(y)\\) out.\n\n\nAnother way to think about this is, for a function of \\(\\theta\\), \\[\np(\\theta \\mid y) \\propto p(y \\mid \\theta) p(\\theta).\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNote\n\n\n\nWe will see that the numerator is the important part, while the denominator is just a normalizing constant to make sure the posterior density integrates to 1.",

    "text": "3.2 Happiness Data – the first example of Bayesian inference procedure\nWe study Bayesian inference for a binomial proportion \\(\\theta\\) when the sample size \\(n\\) is fixed. In this example, we want to see what is the procedure of doing Bayesian inference\n\nIn the 1998 General Social Survey, each female respondent aged 65 or over was asked whether she was generally happy.\nDefine the response variable \\[\nY_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if respondent } i \\text{ reports being generally happy},\\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise},\n\\end{cases}\n\\qquad i = 1,\\ldots,n,\n\\] where \\(n = 129\\).\nBecause we lack information that distinguishes individuals, it is reasonable to treat the responses as exchangeable.\nThat is, before observing the data, the labels or ordering of respondents carry no information.\nSince the sample size \\(n\\) is small relative to the population size \\(N\\) of senior women, results from the previous chapter justify the following modeling approximation.\nModeling Assumptions: Our beliefs about \\((Y_1,\\ldots,Y_{129})\\) are described by:\n\nAn unknown population proportion \\[\n\\theta = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i,\n\\] where \\(\\theta\\) represents the proportion of generally happy individuals in the population.\nA sampling model given \\(\\theta\\)\nConditional on \\(\\theta\\), the responses \\(Y_1,\\ldots,Y_{129}\\) are independent and identically distributed Bernoulli random variables with \\[\n\\Pr(Y_i = 1 \\mid \\theta) = \\theta.\n\\]\n\n\nGiven the population proportion \\(\\theta\\), each respondent independently reports being happy with probability \\(\\theta\\).\n\nLikelihood: Under this model, the probability of observing data \\(\\{y_1,\\ldots,y_{129}\\}\\) given \\(\\theta\\) is \\[\np(y_1,\\ldots,y_{129} \\mid \\theta)\n=\n\\theta^{\\sum_{i=1}^{129} y_i}\n(1-\\theta)^{129-\\sum_{i=1}^{129} y_i}.\n\\]\nThis expression depends on the data only through the sufficient statistic \\[\nS = \\sum_{i=1}^{129} Y_i,\n\\] the total number of respondents who report being generally happy.\nFor the happiness data, \\[\nS = 118,\n\\] so the likelihood simplifies to \\[\np(y_1,\\ldots,y_{129} \\mid \\theta)\n=\n\\theta^{118}(1-\\theta)^{11}.\n\\]\nQ: Which prior to be used?\nA prior distribution is conjugate to a likelihood if the posterior distribution belongs to the same family as the prior. For the binomial likelihood, the Beta distribution is conjugate. But we have another choice of prior, to use non-informative prior.\nA Uniform Prior Distribution: Suppose our prior information about \\(\\theta\\) is very weak, in the sense that all subintervals of \\([0,1]\\) with equal length are equally plausible.\nSymbolically, for any \\(0 \\le a &lt; b &lt; b+c \\le 1\\), \\[\n\\Pr(a \\le \\theta \\le b)\n=\n\\Pr(a+c \\le \\theta \\le b+c).\n\\]\nThis implies a uniform prior: \\[\np(\\theta) = 1, \\qquad 0 \\le \\theta \\le 1.\n\\]\nPosterior Distribution: Bayes’ rule gives \\[\np(\\theta \\mid y_1,\\ldots,y_{129})\n=\n\\frac{p(y_1,\\ldots,y_{129} \\mid \\theta)\\,p(\\theta)}\n     {p(y_1,\\ldots,y_{129})}.\n\\]\nWith a uniform prior, this reduces to \\[\np(\\theta \\mid y_1,\\ldots,y_{129})\n\\propto\n\\theta^{118}(1-\\theta)^{11}.\n\\]\n\nKey idea: with a uniform prior, the posterior has the same shape as the likelihood.\n\nTo obtain a proper probability distribution, we must normalize.\nNormalizing Constant and the Beta Distribution: Using the identity \\[\n\\int_0^1 \\theta^{a-1}(1-\\theta)^{b-1}\\,d\\theta\n=\n\\frac{\\Gamma(a)\\Gamma(b)}{\\Gamma(a+b)},\n\\] we find \\[\np(y_1,\\ldots,y_{129})\n=\n\\frac{\\Gamma(119)\\Gamma(12)}{\\Gamma(131)}.\n\\]\nTherefore, the posterior density is \\[\np(\\theta \\mid y_1,\\ldots,y_{129})\n=\n\\frac{\\Gamma(131)}{\\Gamma(119)\\Gamma(12)}\n\\theta^{119-1}(1-\\theta)^{12-1}.\n\\]\nThat is, \\[\n\\theta \\mid y \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(119,\\,12).\n\\]\nRecall that, a random variable \\(\\theta \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(a,b)\\) distribution if \\[\np(\\theta)\n=\n\\frac{\\Gamma(a+b)}{\\Gamma(a)\\Gamma(b)}\n\\theta^{a-1}(1-\\theta)^{b-1}.\n\\]\nFor \\(\\theta \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(a,b)\\), the expectation (i.e., mean or the first moment) is \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\theta) = \\frac{a}{a+b}\\), and the variance is \\(\\mathrm{Var}(\\theta)=\\frac{ab}{(a+b)^2(a+b+1)}.\\)\nIn our example, the happiness data, the posterior distribution is \\[\n\\theta \\mid y \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(119,12).\n\\]\nThus, the posterior mean is \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\theta \\mid y) = 0.915\\), and the posterior standard deviation is \\(\\mathrm{sd}(\\theta \\mid y) = 0.025\\).\nThese summaries quantify both our best estimate of the population proportion and our remaining uncertainty after observing the data.\n\n\n3.2.1 Inference about exchangeable binary data\nPosterior Inference under a Uniform Prior\nSuppose \\(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n \\mid \\theta \\stackrel{\\text{i.i.d.}}{\\sim} \\text{Bernoulli}(\\theta)\\), and we place a uniform prior on \\(\\theta\\). The posterior distribution of \\(\\theta\\) given the observed data \\(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\) is proportional to \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np(\\theta \\mid y_1, \\ldots, y_n)\n&= \\frac{p(y_1, \\ldots, y_n \\mid \\theta) p(\\theta)}{p(y_1, \\ldots, y_n)} \\\\\n&= \\theta^{\\sum_i y_i}(1 - \\theta)^{n - \\sum_i y_i} \\times \\frac{p(\\theta)}{p(y_1, \\ldots, y_n)}\\\\\n&\\propto\n\\theta^{\\sum_i y_i}(1 - \\theta)^{n - \\sum_i y_i}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nConsider two parameter values \\(\\theta_a\\) and \\(\\theta_b\\). The ratio of their posterior densities is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{p(\\theta_a \\mid y_1, \\ldots, y_n)}\n     {p(\\theta_b \\mid y_1, \\ldots, y_n)}\n&=\\frac{\\theta_a^{\\sum y_i}\\left(1-\\theta_a\\right)^{n-\\sum y_i} \\times p\\left(\\theta_a\\right) / p\\left(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\right)}{\\theta_b^{\\sum y_i}\\left(1-\\theta_b\\right)^{n-\\sum y_i} \\times p\\left(\\theta_b\\right) / p\\left(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\right)} \\\\\n&=\n\\left(\\frac{\\theta_a}{\\theta_b}\\right)^{\\sum_i y_i}\n\\left(\\frac{1 - \\theta_a}{1 - \\theta_b}\\right)^{n - \\sum_i y_i}\n\\frac{p(\\theta_a)}{p(\\theta_b)}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis expression shows that the data affect the posterior distribution only through the sum of the data \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\\) based on the relative probability density at \\(\\theta_a\\) to \\(\\theta_b\\).\nAs a result, for any set \\(A\\), one can show that \\[\n\\Pr(\\theta \\in A \\mid Y_1 = y_1, \\ldots, Y_n = y_n)\n=\n\\Pr\\left(\\theta \\in A \\mid \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i = \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\\right).\n\\]\nThis means that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\\) contains all the information in the data relevant for inference about \\(\\theta\\). We therefore say that \\(Y = \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\\) is a sufficient statistic for \\(\\theta\\). The term sufficient is used because knowing \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\\) is sufficient to carry out inference about \\(\\theta\\); no additional information from the individual observations \\(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n\\) is required.\nIn the case where \\(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n \\mid \\theta\\) are i.i.d. Bernoulli\\((\\theta)\\) random variables, the sufficient statistic \\(Y = \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\\) follows a binomial distribution with parameters \\((n, \\theta)\\).\nThe Binomial Model\nBecause each \\(Y_i\\) is Bernoulli\\((\\theta)\\) and the observations are independent, the sufficient statistic \\(Y = \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\\) follows a binomial distribution with parameters \\((n, \\theta)\\).\nThat is, \\(\\Pr(Y = y \\mid \\theta)=\\binom{n}{y} \\theta^y (1 - \\theta)^{n - y}, \\qquad y = 0, 1, \\ldots, n.\\) For a binomial\\((n, \\theta)\\) random variable \\(Y\\),\n\n\\(\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid \\theta] = n\\theta\\),\n\\(\\mathrm{Var}(Y \\mid \\theta) = n\\theta(1 - \\theta).\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosterior inference under a uniform prior distribution\nHaving observed \\(Y = y\\) our task is to obtain the posterior distribution of \\(\\theta\\). By Bayes’ theorem, \\[\np(\\theta \\mid y)\n= \\frac{p(y \\mid \\theta),p(\\theta)}{p(y)}.\n\\]\nFor a binomial model with \\(Y \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n,\\theta)\\), the likelihood is \\[\np(y \\mid \\theta) = \\binom{n}{y}\\theta^y(1-\\theta)^{n-y}.\n\\]\nTherefore, \\[\np(\\theta \\mid y)\n= \\frac{\\binom{n}{y} \\theta^y(1-\\theta)^{n-y}p(\\theta)}{p(y)}\n= c(y) \\theta^y(1-\\theta)^{n-y}p(\\theta),\n\\] where \\(c(y)\\) is a normalizing constant that depends only on \\(y\\), not on \\(\\theta\\).\n\n\n3.2.2 Confidence regions",

This is particularly valuable in: - Medical research where historical trials exist - Engineering where physical constraints are known - Sequential analysis where data arrive over time\nDirect Inference: Bayesian inference answers the questions researchers actually ask: - “What is the probability that treatment B is better than A given my data?” - “What is a plausible range for this parameter?” - Rather than “If the null hypothesis were true, what is the probability of observing this data?”\nFlexible Modeling: Complex models with multiple parameters, hierarchical structures, or missing data are more naturally expressed in Bayesian frameworks.\nBetter Small-Sample Performance: With limited data, informative priors can stabilize estimates and provide more stable inference than frequentist methods.",

\\theta)^2\\right\\}\\]\n\n\n4.4.2.2 Prior Distribution\nWe use a Normal prior for \\(\\theta\\):\n\\[\\theta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_0, \\tau_0^2)\\]\nwith density: \\[p(\\theta) \\propto \\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{2\\tau_0^2}(\\theta - \\mu_0)^2\\right\\}\\]\n\n\n4.4.2.3 Posterior Distribution\nBy Bayes’ theorem: \\[\\begin{align}\np(\\theta \\mid y) &\\propto p(y \\mid \\theta) \\times p(\\theta) \\\\\n&\\propto \\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{n}{2\\sigma^2}(\\bar{y} - \\theta)^2\\right\\} \\times \\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{2\\tau_0^2}(\\theta - \\mu_0)^2\\right\\}\n\\end{align}\\]\nAfter completing the square, we obtain:\n\\[\\theta \\mid y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_n, \\tau_n^2)\\]\nwhere: \\[\n\\tau_n^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_0^2} + \\frac{n}{\\sigma^2}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\text{prior precision} + \\text{data precision}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mu_n = \\tau_n^2\\left(\\frac{\\mu_0}{\\tau_0^2} + \\frac{n\\bar{y}}{\\sigma^2}\\right)\n\\]\nAlternative form: \\[\\mu_n = w \\mu_0 + (1-w)\\bar{y}\\]\nwhere \\(w = \\frac{\\sigma^2/n}{\\sigma^2/n + \\tau_0^2}\\) is the weight on the prior mean.\n\n\n4.4.2.4 Interpretation\n\nThe posterior mean is a weighted average of the prior mean and the sample mean\nAs \\(n \\to \\infty\\), the posterior mean converges to \\(\\bar{y}\\) (data dominate)\nWith little data, the posterior is pulled toward the prior\nThe posterior precision is the sum of the prior and data precisions\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Posterior Predictive Distribution\nAfter observing data \\(y = (y_1, \\ldots, y_n)\\), we often want to predict a future observation \\(\\tilde{y}\\).\nThe posterior predictive distribution is:\n\\[p(\\tilde{y} \\mid y) = \\int p(\\tilde{y} \\mid \\theta)\\, p(\\theta \\mid y)\\, d\\theta\\]\nThis averages the conditional distribution of \\(\\tilde{y}\\) given \\(\\theta\\) over the posterior uncertainty in \\(\\theta\\).\n\n4.4.3.1 Example: Beta-Binomial\nFor the beta-binomial model with \\(\\theta \\mid y \\sim \\text{Beta}(\\alpha + y, \\beta + n - y)\\):\n\\[P(\\tilde{y} = 1 \\mid y) = E[\\theta \\mid y] = \\frac{\\alpha + y}{\\alpha + \\beta + n}\\]\n\n\n4.4.3.2 Example: Normal Model\nFor the normal model with known variance, if \\(\\theta \\mid y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_n, \\tau_n^2)\\) and \\(\\tilde{y} \\mid \\theta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\theta, \\sigma^2)\\):\n\\[\\tilde{y} \\mid y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_n, \\tau_n^2 + \\sigma^2)\\]\nThe predictive variance includes both parameter uncertainty (\\(\\tau_n^2\\)) and sampling variability (\\(\\sigma^2\\)).\n\n\n\n\n4.4.4 Conjugate Priors\nDefinition: A prior distribution is conjugate to a likelihood if the posterior distribution is in the same family as the prior.\nExamples: - Beta prior + Binomial likelihood → Beta posterior - Normal prior + Normal likelihood (known variance) → Normal posterior - Gamma prior + Poisson likelihood → Gamma posterior\nAdvantages: - Analytical posteriors (no numerical integration needed) - Interpretable parameters - Computationally efficient\nLimitations: - May not reflect true prior beliefs - Modern computing makes non-conjugate priors feasible\n\n\n\n4.4.5 Practical Considerations\n\n4.4.5.1 Prior Elicitation\nHow do we choose a prior?\n\nInformative priors: Based on previous studies or expert knowledge\nWeakly informative priors: Provide some regularization without dominating the data\nNon-informative priors: Attempt to be “objective” (e.g., uniform, Jeffreys prior)\n\n\n\n4.4.5.2 Sensitivity Analysis\n\nTry different priors and check if conclusions change substantially\nIf posterior is sensitive to prior choice with substantial data, investigate further\n\n\n\n4.4.5.3 Comparing Bayesian and Frequentist Inference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect\nBayesian\nFrequentist\n\n\n\n\nParameters\nRandom variables with distributions\nFixed unknown constants\n\n\nProbability statements\nDirect: \\(P(\\theta \\in [a,b] \\mid y)\\)\nIndirect: confidence intervals\n\n\nPrior information\nNaturally incorporated\nDifficult to include\n\n\nSmall samples\nCan be more stable\nMay have poor properties\n\n\nInterpretation\nConditional on observed data\nBased on repeated sampling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.6 R Examples\n\n4.4.6.1 Example 3.1: Beta-Binomial Model\n\n# Data\nn &lt;- 20\ny &lt;- 8\n\n# Prior: Beta(2, 2)\nalpha0 &lt;- 2\nbeta0 &lt;- 2\n\n# Posterior: Beta(10, 14)\nalpha1 &lt;- alpha0 + y\nbeta1 &lt;- beta0 + n -
