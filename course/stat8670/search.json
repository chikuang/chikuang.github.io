R is one of those. R can also be thought of as a high-level programming language. In fact, R is one of the top languages to be used by data analysts and data scientists. There are a lot of analysis packages in R that are currently developed and maintained by researchers around the world to deal with different data problems. And most importantly, R is free. In this book, we will learn how to use R to conduct basic statistical analyses.",
