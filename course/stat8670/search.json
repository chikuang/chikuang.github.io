    "text": "R\nFor conducting analyses with data sets of hundreds to thousands of observations, calculating by hand is not feasible and you will need a statistical software. R is one of those. R can also be thought of as a high-level programming language. In fact, R is one of the top languages to be used by data analysts and data scientists. There are a lot of analysis packages in R that are currently developed and maintained by researchers around the world to deal with different data problems. Most importantly, R is free! In this section, we will learn how to use R to conduct basic statistical analyses.",

It provides a user-friendly interface that includes a source editor, console, environment pane, and tools for plotting, debugging, version control, and package management. RStudio supports both R and Python and is widely used for data analysis, statistical modeling, and reproducible research. It also integrates seamlessly with tools like R Markdown, Shiny, and Quarto, making it popular among data scientists, statisticians, and educators.\n\n\nVisual Studio Code (VS Code)\nVS Code is a versatile code editor that supports multiple programming languages, including R. With the R extension for VS Code, users can write and execute R code, access R’s console, and utilize features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging. While not as specialized as RStudio for R development, VS Code offers a lightweight alternative with extensive customization options and support for various programming tasks.\n\n\nPositron\nPositron IDE is the next-generation integrated development environment developed by Posit, the company behind RStudio. Designed to be a modern, extensible, and language-agnostic IDE, Positron builds on the strengths of RStudio while supporting a broader range of languages and workflows, including R, Python, and Quarto.",
