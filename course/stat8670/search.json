    "text": "1.10 Pipe\nPipe operator |&gt; (native after R version 4.0) or %&gt;$ (from magrittr package) is a powerful tool in R that allows you to chain together multiple operations in a clear and concise way. It takes the output of one function and passes it as the first argument to the next function.\nFor example, we can write\n\nset.seed(777)\nx &lt;- rnorm(5)\n\n## Without using pipe\nprint(round(mean(x), 2))\n\n[1] 0.37\n\n## Using pipe\nx |&gt; \n  mean() |&gt; # applying the mean function\n  round(2) |&gt; #round to 2nd decimal place\n  print()\n\n[1] 0.37\n\n\nWe can see that, without using the pipe, if we are applying multiple functions to the same object, we may have hard time to track. This can make the code less readable and harder to maintain. On the other hand, using pipe, we can clearly see the sequence of operations being applied to the data, making it easier to understand and modify.\n\n1.10.1 Some rules\n|&gt; should always have a space before it and should typically be the last thing on a line. This simplifies adding new steps, reorganizing existing ones, and modifying elements within each step.\nNote that all of the packages in the tidyverse family support the pipe operator (except ggplot2!), so you can use it with any of them.",

    "text": "1.11 Questions in class\n\n1.11.1 Lecture 1, August 25, 2025\nQ1. If I know Python already, why learn R?\nReply: My general take are 1). R is more specialized for statistical analysis and data visualization, while Python is a more general-purpose programming language. 2). R has a rich ecosystem of packages and libraries specifically designed for statistical computing, making it a popular choice among statisticians and data scientists. 3). R’s syntax and data structures are often more intuitive for statistical tasks, which can lead to faster development and easier collaboration with other statisticians. 4). Also, the tidyverse ecosystem including ggplot and others are a big plus when dealing with big dataframes. 5). They are not meant to replace each other, but work as a complement.\nQ2. Why my installation of R sometimes failed on a Windows machine?\nReply: There are many reasons. One of the most common reasons is that you may need to manually add the path to the environment variable.\n\n\n1.11.2 Lecture 2, August 27, 2025\nQ1. What’s the difference of using apply v.s. looping in R?\nReply: The apply functions are often faster and more efficient than looping, especially for large datasets, because they have done some vectorization under the hood. Also, it has much higher readibility and better conciseness. However, depends on the task, you may want to do the benchmarking to see the performance difference.\nQ2. How to use pipe with two or more variables?\nReply: There are several ways to do this.\n\nWithin the tidyverse family: One way is to use the dplyr package, which provides a set of functions that work well with the pipe operator. For example, you can use the mutate() function to create a new variable based on two existing variables. For example, you can do\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(magrittr)  # for %$%\nlibrary(purrr)     # for pmap / exec if needed\n\nmy_df &lt;- tibble(x = 1:5, y = 6:10)\nf  &lt;- function(a, b) a + 2*b\n\nmy_df %&gt;%\n  mutate(z = f(x, y))\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n      x     y     z\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1     6    13\n2     2     7    16\n3     3     8    19\n4     4     9    22\n5     5    10    25\n\n\n\nUsing base R, you may do something like the following through the magrittr package’s exposition pipe %$%:\n\n\nlibrary(magrittr)\n# method 1\nmy_df %$% f(x, y) \n\n[1] 13 16 19 22 25\n\n# or use . as a placeholder\n# method 2\nmy_df %&gt;% { f(.$x, .$y) }\n\n[1] 13 16 19 22 25\n\n\n\nSome of the materials are adapted from CMU Stat36-350.\nA comprehensive reference for all the tidyverse tools is R for Data Science.\nA comprehensive reference for ggplot2 is ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis.",

    "text": "2.1 Theory versus Computation\nThe optimization plays an important role in statistical computing, especially in the context of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and other statistical inference methods. This chapter will cover various optimization techniques used in statistical computing.\nThere is a general principle that will be repeated in this chapter that Kenneth Lange calls optimization transfer in his 1999 paper. The basic idea applies to the problem of maximizing a function \\(f\\).\nNote 1: steps 2&3 are repeated until convergence.\nNote 2: maximizing \\(f\\) is equivalent to minimizing \\(-f\\).\nNote 3: the surrogate function \\(g\\) should be chosen such that it is easier to optimize than \\(f\\).\nFor instance, for a linear regression \\[\\begin{equation}\n  y = X\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\varepsilon. \\label{eq:linmod}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nFrom regression class, we know that the (ordinary) least-squares estimation (OLE) for \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is given by \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}=(X^\\top X)^{-1} X^\\top y\\). It is convenient as the solution is in the closed-form! However, in the most case, the closed-form solutions will not be available.\nFor GLMs or non-linear regression, we need to do this iterativelly!\nOne confusing aspect of statistical computing is that often there is a disconnect between what is printed in a statistical computing textbook and what should be implemented on the computer.\nSome potential issues includ:\nA &lt;- matrix(\n  c(1, 2, 3,\n    4, 5, 6,\n    7, 8, 9),\n  nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\nB &lt;- A\nB[3, 3] &lt;- B[3, 3] + 1E-5\n\nqr(A)$rank\n\n[1] 2\n\nqr(B)$rank\n\n[1] 3",

    "text": "In textbooks, simpler to present solutions as convenient mathematical formulas whenever possible, in order to communicate basic ideas and to provide some insight.\n\nHowever, directly translating these formulas into computer code is usually not advisable because there are many problematic aspects of computers that are simply not relevant when writing things down on paper.\n\n\n\n\nMemory overflow: The computer has a limited amount of memory, and it is possible to run out of memory when working with large datasets or complex models.\nNumerical Precision: Sometimes, due to the cut precision of floating-point arithmetic, calculations that are mathematically equivalent can yield different results on a computer.\n\nExample 1: round \\(1/3\\) to two decimal places, we get \\(0.33\\). Then, \\(3 \\cdot (1/3)\\) is exactly \\(1\\), but \\(3 \\cdot 0.33\\) is \\(0.99\\).\nExample 2: \\(1 - 0.99999999\\) is \\(0.00000001\\) (=1E-8), but if we round \\(0.99999999\\) to two decimal places, we get \\(1.00\\), and then \\(1 - 1.00\\) is \\(0\\). If we round \\(0.00000001\\) to two decimal places, we get \\(0.00\\).\nExample 3: \\(\\pi\\)\n\n(Lienar) Dependence: The detection of linear dependence in matrix computations is influenced by machine precision. Since computers operate with finite precision, situations often arise where true linear dependence exists, but the computer cannot distinguish it from independence.\n\nExample: Consider the matrix \\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n7 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\] The 3rd column is a linear combination of the first two columns (i.e., col3 = col1 + col2). However, due to machine precision limitations, the computer might not recognize this exact linear dependence, leading to numerical instability in computations involving this matrix. With a small distortion, we have \\[\nB = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n7 & 8 & 9 + 10^{-5} \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]",

    "text": "2.2 Matrix Inversion\nIn many statistical analyses, such as linear regression and specify the distribution (such as normal distribution), matrix inversion plays a central role.\n\n2.2.1 Example 1: Normal distribution\nWe know that, a normal density with the parameters mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is \\[\nf\\left(x \\mid \\mu, \\sigma^2\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi} \\sigma} \\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{2 \\sigma^2}(x-\\mu)^2\\right\\}\n\\] or we may work on the multivariate normal distribution case which is a bit more involved.\n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{X} = (X1,\\dots, X_d)\\) is said to be a multivariate normal distribution if and only if it is a linear comibnation of independent and identically distributed standard normals: \\[\n\\boldsymbol{X} = \\boldsymbol{CZ} + \\mu,\\quad \\boldsymbol{Z}=(Z_1,\\dots,Z_d),\\quad Z_i \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim} N(0,1).\n\\]\n\nThe property of the multivariate normal are:\n\nmean vector: \\(E(\\boldsymbol{X}) = \\mu\\)\nvariance: \\(Var(\\boldsymbol{X}) = \\boldsymbol{CZC}^\\top = \\boldsymbol{C} var(\\boldsymbol{Z})\\boldsymbol{C}^\\top:=  \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\)\n\nNotation: \\(\\boldsymbol{X} \\sim N(\\mu, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})\\).\nPDF: \\[\nf(\\boldsymbol{x} \\mid \\mu, \\Sigma)=(2 \\pi)^{-d / 2} \\cdot \\exp \\left\\{-\\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu})^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1}(\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu})-\\frac{1}{2} \\log |\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}|\\right\\}.\n\\] Some of the potential ways to do this is to take logarithm of the PDF (Think about why).\n\n\n2.2.2 Example 2: Linear regression\nRecall the linear regression model . The OLE for \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is given by \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}=(X^\\top X)^{-1} X^\\top y\\).\nWe can solve this using the R command\nbeta_hat &lt;- solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% y\nwhere solve() is the R function for matrix inversion. However, it is not a desired way (think about why).\nA better way is to go back to the formula, and look at \\[\nX^\\top X\\boldsymbol{\\beta}= X^\\top y,\n\\] and solve this using the R command\nsolve( crossprod(X), crossprod(X, y) ) \n# this is the same as \n# solve(t(X) %*% X, t(X) %*% y)\nHere, we avoid explicitly calculating the inverse of \\(X^\\top X\\). Instead, we use gaussian elimination to solve the system of equations, which is generally more numerically stable and efficient.\n\n2.2.2.1 Speed comparison\nset.seed(2025-09-03)\nX &lt;- matrix(rnorm(5000 * 100), 5000, 100)\ny &lt;- rnorm(5000)\nlibrary(microbenchmark)\nmicrobenchmark(solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% y)\nUnit: milliseconds\n                             expr      min       lq\n solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% y 28.83505 30.16593\n     mean   median       uq      max neval\n 31.96782 30.79489 32.63315 111.0151   100\nWarning message:\nIn microbenchmark(solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% y) :\n  less accurate nanosecond times to avoid potential integer overflows\nmicrobenchmark(solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% y,\n               solve(crossprod(X), crossprod(X, y)))\nUnit: milliseconds\n                                 expr      min       lq\n     solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% y 28.90135 30.11608\n solve(crossprod(X), crossprod(X, y)) 25.05859 25.27480\n     mean   median       uq      max neval\n 31.78686 31.38513 32.66482 53.03354   100\n 26.15771 25.81678 26.89188 29.12045   100\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Take home message:\nThe take home here is that the issues arise from the finite precision of computer arithmetic and the limited memory available on computers. When implementing statistical methods on a computer, it is crucial to consider these limitations and choose algorithms and implementations that are robust to numerical issues.\n\n\n2.2.4 Multi-collinearity\nThe above approach may break down when there is any multi-colinearity in the \\(\\boldsymbol{X}\\) matrix. For example, we can tack on a column to \\(\\boldsymbol{X}\\) that is very similar (but not identical) to the first column of \\(\\boldsymbol{X}\\).\n\nset.seed(7777)\nN &lt;- 3000\nK &lt;- 100\ny &lt;- rnorm(N)\nX &lt;- matrix(rnorm(N * K), N, K)\nW &lt;- cbind(X, X[, 1] + rnorm(N, sd = 1E-15))\n\nsolve(crossprod(W), crossprod(W, y))\n\nError in `solve.default()`:\n! system is computationally singular: reciprocal condition number = 1.36748e-32\nThe algorithm does not work because the cross product matrix \\(W^\\top W\\) is singular. In practice, matrices like these can come up a lot in data analysis and it would be useful to have a way to deal with it automatically.\nR takes a different approach to solving for the unknown coefficients in a linear model. R uses the QR decomposition, which is not as fast, but has the added benefit of being able to automatically detect and handle colinear columns in the matrix.\nHere, we use the fact that X can be decomposed as \\(\\boldsymbol{X}=QR\\), where \\(Q\\) is an orthonormal matrix and \\(R\\) is an upper triangular matrix. Given that, we can rewrite \\(X^\\top X \\boldsymbol{\\beta}= X^\\top y\\) as \\[\\begin{align*}\nR^\\top Q^\\top Q R \\boldsymbol{\\beta}&= R^\\top Q^\\top y\\\\\nR^\\top I R \\boldsymbol{\\beta}&= R^\\top Q^\\top y\\\\\nR^\\top R \\boldsymbol{\\beta}&= R^\\top Q^\\top y,\n\\end{align*}\\] this leads to \\(R\\boldsymbol{\\beta}= Q^\\top y\\). Now we can perform the Gaussian elimination to do it. Because \\(R\\) is an upper triangular matrix, the computational speed is much faster. Here, we avoid to compute the cross product \\(X^\\top X\\), which is numerical unstable if it is not standardized properly\nWe can see in R code that even with our singular matrix \\(W\\) above, the QR decomposition continues without error.\n\nQw &lt;- qr(W)\nstr(Qw)\n\nList of 4\n $ qr   : num [1:3000, 1:101] 54.43933 0.00123 -0.02004 -0.00671 -0.00178 ...\n $ rank : int 100\n $ qraux: num [1:101] 1.01 1.01 1.01 1 1 ...\n $ pivot: int [1:101] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"qr\"\n\n\nNote that the output of qr() computes the rank of \\(W\\) to be 100, not 101 as the last column is collinear to the 1st column.

However, in certain specialized and performance-critical settings, it can be advantageous to use alternative matrix decompositions to compute regression coefficients, especially when the computation must be repeated many times in a loop (i.e., Vectorization)\n\n\n2.2.6 Multivariate Normal revisit\nComputing the multivariate normal (MVN) density is a common task, for example, when fitting spatial models or Gaussian process models. Because maximum likelihood estimation(MLE) and likelihood ratio tests (LRT) often require evaluating the likelihood many times, efficiency is crucial.\nAfter taking the log of the MVN density, we have\n\\[\n\\ell(\\boldsymbol{x}\\mid \\boldsymbol{\\mu},\\Sigma) := \\log \\left\\{ f(\\boldsymbol{x}\\mid \\boldsymbol{\\mu},\\Sigma) \\right\\}\n= -\\frac{d}{2}\\log(2\\pi) - \\frac{1}{2}\\log|\\Sigma| - \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu})^\\top \\Sigma^{-1}(\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}).\n\\] On the right hand side, the first term is a constant, the second term is linear, and the last term is quadratic, which requires much more computational power.\n\n2.2.6.1 A Naive Implementation\nWe first center the data \\(\\boldsymbol{z}:=\\boldsymbol{x}- \\mu\\). Then we have \\(\\boldsymbol{z}^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} \\boldsymbol{z}\\). This simiplified the question for a bit.\nHere, much like the linear regression example above, the key bottleneck is the inversion of the \\(p\\)-dimensional covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\). If we take \\(\\boldsymbol{z}\\) to be a \\(p\\times 1\\) column vector, then a literal translation of the mathematics into R code might look something like this,\nt(z) %*% solve(Sigma) %*% z\nTo illustrate, let’s simulate some data and compute the quadratic form the naive way:\n\nset.seed(2025-09-03)\n\n# Generate data\nz &lt;- matrix(rnorm(200 * 100), 200, 100)\nS &lt;- cov(z)\n\n# Naive quadratic form\nquad.naive &lt;- function(z, S) {\n  Sinv &lt;- solve(S)\n  rowSums((z %*% Sinv) * z)\n}\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nquad.naive(z, S) %&gt;% summary()\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n  70.67   93.61   99.94  100.54  107.31  126.73 \n\n\n\n\n2.2.6.2 A Better Way: Cholesky Decomposition\nBecause the covariance matrix is symmetric and positive definite, we can exploit its Cholesky decomposition. That is, we write \\(\\Sigma = R^\\top R\\), where \\(R\\) is a upper triangular matrix. Then, \\[\n\\boldsymbol{z}^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} \\boldsymbol{z}= \\boldsymbol{z}^\\top (R^\\top R)^{-1} \\boldsymbol{z}= \\boldsymbol{z}^\\top R^{-1}R^{-\\top} \\boldsymbol{z}= (R^{-\\top}\\boldsymbol{z})^\\top (R^{-\\top} \\boldsymbol{z}) := \\boldsymbol{v}^\\top \\boldsymbol{v}.\n\\] Note that \\(\\boldsymbol{v}\\in \\mathbb R^p\\) is the solution to the linear system \\(R^\\top \\boldsymbol{v}= \\boldsymbol{z}\\). Because \\(R\\) is upper triangular, we can solve this system efficiently using back substitution. Also, we can solve this without doing the inversion.\nOnce we have \\(\\boldsymbol{v}\\) we can compute its quadratic form \\(\\boldsymbol{v}^\\top \\boldsymbol{v}\\) by the crossprod() function.\n\nquad.chol &lt;- function(z, S) {\n  R &lt;- chol(S)\n  v &lt;- backsolve(R, t(z), transpose = TRUE)\n  colSums(v * v)\n}\n\nquad.chol(z, S) %&gt;% summary()\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n  70.67   93.61   99.94  100.54  107.31  126.73 \n\n\n\n\n2.2.6.3 By product\nAnother benefit of the Cholesky decomposition is that it gives us a simple way to compute the log-determinant of \\(\\Sigma\\). The log-determinant of \\(\\Sigma\\) is simply two times the sum of the log of the diagonal elements of R. (Why?)\n\n\n2.2.6.4 Performance comparison\n\nlibrary(microbenchmark)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nm2 &lt;- microbenchmark(\n  naive = quad.naive(z, S),\n  chol  = quad.chol(z, S)\n)\nautoplot(m2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: Why one is faster than the other?\n\n\n2.2.6.5 Take home message 2\nThe naive algorithm simply inverts the covariance matrix. The Cholesky-based approach, on the other hand, exploits the fact that covariance matrices are symmetric and positive definite. This results in an implementation that is both faster and numerically more stable—exactly the kind of optimization that makes a difference in real-world statistical computing.\nThus, a knowledge of statistics and numerical analysis can often lead to better algorithms, often invaluable!",

Some of the algorithms include:\n\nGradient Descent\nNewton’s Method\nConjugate Gradient Method\nQuasi-Newton Methods (e.g., BFGS)\nInterior Point Methods\n\nThey often rely on the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions.\n\n2.5.1 Root finding\nThe root finding is probably the first numerical approach you learned in the numerical analysis course. Consider a function \\(f: \\mathbb R\\to \\mathbb R\\). The point \\(x\\in \\mathbb R\\) is called a root of \\(f\\) if \\(f(x) = 0\\).\nQ: Why do we care about the root finding?\nThis idea has broad applications. While finding the values of x such that f(x) = 0 is useful in many settings, a more general task is to determine the values of x for which f(x) = y. The same techniques used to find the roots of a function can be applied here by rewriting the problem as \\[\n\\tilde{f}(x) := f(x) - y = 0.\n\\] In this way, new function \\(\\tilde{f}(x)\\) has a root at the solution to, \\(f(x)=y\\), original equation.\nFor linear function, it is trivial. For quadratic function, we can use the quadratic formula, i.e., \\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.\n\\] However, for more complex functions, we need to use numerical methods to solve it iteratively. Below, we are going to go over some numerical algorithms.\n\n\n2.5.2 One-dimensional case\nWe first look at the one-dimensional case. The function we want to optimize is\n\\[f(x) = x^3 - x + 1\\]\n\n\n2.5.3 Bisection method\nBisection method is just like a binary search.\n\nStep 1. Selection two points \\(a,b\\in \\chi \\subseteq \\mathbb R\\), where \\(\\chi\\) is the domain of \\(f\\). Make sure that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have opposite signs, i.e., \\(f(a)f(b) &lt; 0\\).\nStep 2. Compute the midpoint \\(c = (a+b)/2\\).\nStep 3. Evaluate and check the sign of \\(f(c)\\). If \\(f(c)\\) has the same sign as \\(f(a)\\), then set \\(a=c\\). Otherwise, set \\(b=c\\).\nStep 4.

The idea here is to use the Taylor expansion of the function. Suppose we are search a small neighbour of the solution \\(x \\in \\mathbb R\\), say \\(x_j \\in \\mathbb R\\) is a small number. Then Then we first order Taylor series to approximate \\(f(x_j+h)\\) around \\(x_j\\) is \\[\nf(x)\\approx f(x_j) +  f^\\prime(x_j) (x-x_j),\n\\] where \\(f^\\prime(x) := \\partial_x f(x)\\) is the first derivative of \\(f(x)\\). So the root of this approximation can be improved by updating its place to where \\(f(x_{j+1}) = 0\\).\nSo if \\(f(x_j+h)\\) is the root, then we have \\[ 0 = f(x_j) + f^\\prime(x_j) h \\implies h = -\\frac{f(x_j)}{f^\\prime(x_j)}.\\]\nThen, we can come back to \\(x_{j+1}= x_j+h\\), and plug the value of \\(h\\) in from above, we have \\[\nx_{j+1} = x_j - \\frac{f(x_j)}{f^\\prime(x_j)}.\n\\]\nThe algorithm is given as below:\n\nLet \\(f:\\mathbb R\\to\\mathbb R\\) be differentiable.\nStep 0: Choose a function \\(f(x)\\): This is the function for which you want to find a root (i.e., solve \\(f(x) = 0\\)).\nStep 1: Calculate the derivative \\(f^\\prime(x)\\): You will need it to apply the formula.\nStep 2: Make an initial guess \\(x_0\\): Select a starting point \\(x_0\\) near the expected root.\nStep 3: Update the estimate: Use the Newton’s method formula to compute the next estimate \\(x_1\\) using \\(x_0\\) by \\[x_{j+1} = x_j - \\frac{f(x_j)}{f^\\prime(x_j)}.\\]\nStep 4: Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until the values converge to a root or reach a desired tolerance.\n\n\n## Function and derivative\nf  &lt;- function(x) 0.5*x^3 - 0.5*x - 18\ndf &lt;- function(x) 1.5*x^2 - 0.5\n\n## Newton–Raphson with iterate tracking\nnewton_raphson &lt;- function(f, df, x0, tol = 1e-5, \n                           maxit = 100, eps = 1e-5) {\n  x &lt;- x0\n  xs &lt;- x0      # store iterates (x0, x1, x2, ...)\n  for (k in 1:maxit) {\n    fx  &lt;- f(x)\n    dfx &lt;- df(x)\n    x_new &lt;- x - fx/dfx\n    xs &lt;- c(xs, x_new)\n    if (abs(x_new - x) &lt; tol || abs(fx) &lt; tol) {\n      return(list(root = x_new, iter = k, path = xs))\n    }\n    x &lt;- x_new\n  }\n  list(root = x, iter = maxit, path = xs)\n}\n\n## Starting point\n\nIf we start at -1 which is far away from\n\nx0 &lt;- -1\nres &lt;- newton_raphson(f, df, x0)\na &lt;- -2; b &lt;- 5\nplot(function(x) f(x), from = a, to = b, \n     xlab = \"x\", ylab = \"f(x)\",\n     main = paste(\"Newton-Raphson (Iterations:\", res$iter, \")\"))\nabline(h = 0, col = \"blue\", lty = 2)\n\n## Draw vertical lines for each iterate with labels 0,1,2,...\nfor (i in seq_along(res$path)) {\n  xi &lt;- res$path[i]\n  abline(v = xi, col = \"red\", lty = 2)\n  text(xi, par(\"usr\")[3] + 2, labels = i - 1, col = \"blue\", pos = 3, cex = 0.9)\n}\n\n## Final root marker + label\nabline(v = res$root, col = \"darkgreen\", lwd = 2)\ntext(res$root, par(\"usr\")[3] + 5,\n     labels = paste0(\"Root ~= \", round(res$root, 5),\n                     \" ; f(root) ~= \", signif(f(res$root), 3)),\n     col = \"darkgreen\", pos = 3, cex = 0.95, font = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nres\n\n$root\n[1] 3.402848\n\n$iter\n[1] 9\n\n$path\n [1] -1.000000 17.000000 11.387991  7.704327  5.368534  4.042133  3.500619\n [8]  3.405629  3.402850  3.402848\n\n\nIf we start at 3 which is near to the point\n\nx0 &lt;- 3\nres &lt;- newton_raphson(f, df, x0)\n## Plot range that shows the iterates and root\na &lt;- -2; b &lt;- 5\nplot(function(x) f(x), from = a, to = b, \n     xlab = \"x\", ylab = \"f(x)\",\n     main = paste(\"Newton-Raphson (Iterations:\", res$iter, \")\"))\nabline(h = 0, col = \"blue\", lty = 2)\n\n## Draw vertical lines for each iterate with labels 0,1,2,...\nfor (i in seq_along(res$path)) {\n  xi &lt;- res$path[i]\n  abline(v = xi, col = \"red\", lty = 2)\n  text(xi, par(\"usr\")[3] + 2, labels = i - 1, col = \"blue\", pos = 3, cex = 0.9)\n}\n\n## Final root marker + label\nabline(v = res$root, col = \"darkgreen\", lwd = 2)\ntext(res$root, par(\"usr\")[3] + 5,\n     labels = paste0(\"Root ~= \", round(res$root, 5),\n                     \" ; f(root) ~= \", signif(f(res$root), 3)),\n     col = \"darkgreen\", pos = 3, cex = 0.95, font = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nres\n\n$root\n[1] 3.402848\n\n$iter\n[1] 4\n\n$path\n[1] 3.000000 3.461538 3.403866 3.402848 3.402848\n\n\nRemarks:\n\nAssumptions: \\(f\\) is differentiable in a neighborhood of the root \\(r\\).\nFailure cases: if \\(f^\\prime(x_j)=0\\) (or is very small), the update is ill-defined/unstable; if the initial guess is far, the method can diverge or jump to a different root.\nPractical checks: stop when \\(|f(x_j)|\\le \\delta\\) or \\(|x_{j+1}-x_j| \\le \\delta\\) is below tolerance \\(\\delta\\).\n\n\n\n2.5.5 Second Method\nThe secant method can be thought of as a finite-difference approximation of Newton’s method, so it is considered a quasi-Newton method. It is simialr to Newton’s method, but it does not require the computation of the derivative of the function. Instead, it approximates the derivative using two previous points.\nIn the second method, we require the first two points, say \\(x_0, x_1 \\in \\mathbb R\\). Then, we can approximate the derivative of \\(f\\) at \\(x_1\\) using the finite difference formula. Instead of calculate the derivative \\(f^\\prime(x_1)\\), we approximate it as using the secant line. In calculate, we know that, \\(f^\\prime(x_1) \\approx \\frac{f(x_1)-f(x_0)}{x_1-x_0}\\), if \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_0\\) are close. Then, we can plug this approximation into the Newton’s update formula to get \\[x_j  = x_{j-1}  - f(x_{j-1}) \\frac{x_{j-1}-x_{j-2}}{f(x_{j-1}) - f(x_{j-2})} = \\frac{x_{j-2} f\\left(x_{j-1}\\right)-x_{j-1} f\\left(x_{j-2}\\right)}{f\\left(x_{j-1}\\right)-f\\left(x_{j-2}\\right)} .\\]",

    "text": "2.7 Converegence\nIn order to compare the efficiency of the set of algorithms, one may compare their abilities for finding the optimals. However, what if, say, two algorithms both can find optimals, which one is better? The convergence rate comes in. Convergence rate is a measure of how quickly an iterative algorithm approaches its limit or optimal solution, which mean, how fast the algorithm converges to the optimals.\nIn the previous lecture(s), we saw that we can use R functions such microbenchmark::microbenchmark(), to measure the performance. However, it may takes a long time and a lot of computational resources. For such cases, we may use the theoretical convergence rate to compare the efficiency of the algorithms.\nThe convergence rate is often classified into several categories. It acts like the sequence \\(\\{x_j\\}\\) we learned in grade schools. Here, \\(\\{x_j\\}\\) is a sequence of estimates generated by the algorithm at each iterations, and \\(x^*\\) is the true solution or optimal value we are trying to reach. The error at iteration \\(n\\) is defined as \\(e_j = d(x_j,x^*)\\), where the typical metric here is the absolute distance \\(d(x_j,x^*)=|x_j-x^*|\\) (note, in spaces, different metric to define the distance). The convergence rate describes how quickly this error sequence \\(\\{e_j\\}\\) decreases as \\(j\\) increases.

The name and concept are derived from the process of annealing in metallurgy, where a material is heated and then slowly cooled to remove defects and achieve a stable crystalline structure. In Simulated Annealing, the “heat” corresponds to the degree of randomness in the search process, which decreases over time (cooling schedule) to refine the solution. The method is widely used in combinatorial optimization, where problems often have numerous local optima that standard techniques like gradient descent might get stuck in. Simulated Annealing excels in escaping these local minima by introducing controlled randomness in its search, allowing for a more thorough exploration of the solution space.\nSome terminology:\n\nTemperature: controls how likely the algorithm is to accept worse solutions as it explores the search space.\n\n\nStep 1 (Initilization): Begin with an initial solution \\(S_ο\\) and an initial temperature \\(T_ο\\).\nStep 2 (Neighborhood Search): At step \\(j\\), a new solution \\(S^\\prime\\) is generated by making a small change (or perturbation) to \\(S_j\\).\nStep 3 (Evaluation): evaluate the objective function \\(f(S^\\prime)\\) Step 3.1: If \\(f^(S^\\prime)\\) is better than \\(f(S_j)\\), we accept it and take it as \\(S_{j+1}\\).

The pmf is \\(f(x) = p q^x\\), \\(x = 0,1,2,\\ldots\\).

The basic method to generate a Poisson(\\(\\lambda\\)) variate is to generate and store the cdf via the recursive formula \\[\nf(x+1) = \\frac{\\lambda f(x)}{x+1},\n\\qquad\nF(x+1) = F(x) + f(x+1).\n\\]",

    "text": "3.3 Acceptance-Rejection Method\nIn the previous section, we have seen that the ITM is straightforward to implement when the inverse cdf is available in closed form. However, for many distributions, the inverse cdf is not available in closed form or is difficult to compute. In those cases, we need to have other strategies!\nThe acceptance-rejection method (ARM) is a general method for generating rvs from a distribution with pdf \\(f_X(x)\\), when the inverse cdf is not available in closed form or is difficult to compute.\n\nSuppose \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are rvs with pdfs/pmds \\(f_X(x)\\) and \\(g_Y(y)\\), respectively. Further we suppose there is a constant \\(k\\) such that \\[\n\\frac{f_X(t)}{g_Y(t)} \\leq k,\n\\] for all \\(t\\) such that \\(f_X(t) &gt; 0\\).\nThen we can simulate \\(X\\) using the following procedure:\n\nFind a rv \\(Y\\) with density \\(g_Y(\\cdot)\\) satisfying \\(f_X(t)/g_Y(t) \\le k,\\) for all \\(t\\) such that \\(f(t) &gt; 0\\).\nFor each rv, required:\n\nGenerate a random \\(y\\) from the distribution with density \\(g_Y\\).\nGenerate a random \\(u\\sim \\operatorname{Unif}(0,1)\\).\nIf \\(u &lt; f_X(y)/(k g_Y(y))\\), accept \\(y\\) and set \\(x = y\\); o.w. reject \\(y\\) and jump back to (i)\n\n\n\nWhy it work?Note that in Step 2c, \\[\nP(\\text{accept} \\mid Y)\n= P\\!\\left(U &lt; \\frac{f(Y)}{c g(Y)} \\,\\Big|\\, Y\\right)\n= \\frac{f_X(Y)}{c g_X(Y)}.\n\\]\nThe total probability of acceptance for any iteration is therefore \\[\n\\sum_y P(\\text{accept} \\mid y) P(Y = y)\n= \\sum_y \\frac{f(y)}{c g(y)} g(y)\n= \\frac{1}{k},\n\\] and the number of iterations until acceptance has the geometric distribution with mean \\(k\\). That means, in order to sample \\(X\\), in average, we need \\(k\\) iterations.\nNote: The choice of \\(Y\\) and \\(k\\) is crucial for the efficiency of the ARM. A poor choice can lead to a large \\(k\\), resulting in many rejections and inefficiency. We want \\(Y\\) to be easy to simulate, and \\(k\\) to be as small as possible.\nDoes this have anything to do with \\(X\\)?\nTo see that the accepted sample has the same distribution as \\(X\\), apply Bayes’ Theorem. In the discrete case, for each \\(\\ell\\) such that \\(f(\\ell) &gt; 0\\), \\[\nP(\\ell \\mid \\text{accepted})\n= \\frac{P(\\text{accepted} \\mid \\ell) g(\\ell)}{P(\\text{accepted})}\n= \\frac{\\big[f(\\ell)/(k g(\\ell))\\big] g(\\ell)}{1/k}\n= f(\\ell).\n\\]\n\nThis example illustrates the acceptance–rejection method for the beta distribution.\nQ: On average, how many random numbers must be simulated to generate \\(N=1000\\) samples from the \\(\\operatorname{Beta}\\)(,)$ distribution by ARM?\nA: Depends on the upper bound \\(k\\) of \\(f_X(t)/_Yg(t)\\), which depends on the choice of the function \\(g_Y(\\cdot)\\).\nRecall that the \\(\\operatorname{Beta}(2,2)\\) density is \\[\nf(t) = 6t(1-t), \\quad 0 &lt; t &lt; 1.\n\\] Let \\(g(\\cdot)\\) be the Uniform(0,1) density. Then \\[\n\\frac{f(t)}{g(t)} = \\frac{6t(1-t)}{(1)} = 6t(1-t) \\leq k \\quad \\text{for all } 0 &lt; t &lt; 1.\n\\] It is easy to see that \\(k = 6\\). A random \\(x\\) from \\(g(x)\\) is accepted if \\[\n\\frac{f(x)}{kg(x)} = \\frac{6x(1-x)}{6(1)} = x(1-x) &gt; u.\n\\]\nOn average, \\(kN = 6\\cdot 1000 =6000\\) iterations (12000 random numbers as we need \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)) will be required for \\(N=1000\\). In the following simulation, the counter \\(\\operatorname{iter}\\) for iterations is not necessary, but included to record how many iterations were actually needed to generate the 1000 beta rvs.\n\nset.seed(7777)\nN &lt;- 1000\nell_accept &lt;- 0       # counter for accepted\niter &lt;- 0       # iterations\ny &lt;- rep(0, N)\n\nwhile (ell_accept &lt; N) {\n  u &lt;- runif(1)\n  iter &lt;- iter + 1\n  x &lt;- runif(1)   # random variate from g\n  if (x * (1-x) &gt; u) {\n    # we accept x\n    ell_accept &lt;- ell_accept + 1\n    y[ell_accept] &lt;- x\n  }\n}\n\niter\n\n[1] 5972\n\n\nIn this simulation, 5972 iterations ( 1.1944^{4} random numbers) were required to generate the 1000 beta samples.",

As \\(n\\) approaches infinity and the probability of success approaches \\(0\\), where \\(n\\theta\\) remains fixed. We can define \\(n\\theta = \\lambda\\), and obtain the distribution called Poisson.\nA random variable X has the Poisson Distribution if and only if its probability distribution is given by:\n\\[P(x;\\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^x e^{-\\lambda}}{x!}, \\quad x = 0,1,2,\\ldots\\]\n\n# Generate 10,000 samples from Poisson(λ = 2)\nX &lt;- rpois(10000, 2)\n\n# Histogram of simulated data\nhist(X)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Probability that X &gt; 3 (estimated by simulation)\nmean(X &gt; 3)\n\n[1] 0.1351\n\n# Probability that X = 0 (estimated by simulation)\nmean(X == 0)\n\n[1] 0.1354\n\n# Theoretical probability that X = 0\nexp(-2)\n\n[1] 0.1353353\n\n# Sample mean and variance of simulated distribution\nmean(X)\n\n[1] 1.9828\n\nvar(X)\n\n[1] 1.9549\n\n\n\nThe mean and variance of the Poisson distribution are\n\\[\\mathbb{E}X = \\lambda, \\qquad \\mathbb{V}ar(X) = \\lambda\\]\n\nThe Poisson distribution is derived as the limiting case of the Binomial (with the above mentioned restrictions) BUT there are many more applications. It models:\n\nNumber of successes to occur in a given time period\nNumber of telephone calls received in a given time\nNumber of misprints on a page\nNumber of customers entering a bank during various intervals of time\n\n⸻\nWe are now moving onto the continuous distributions that play an important role in Statistical Theory.",

It is defined by its mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)). It is also known as the Normal Distribution. A continuous random variable follows a Normal Distribution if and only if its probability density function is given by\n\\[\nf_X(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\!\\left( -\\dfrac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right), & -\\infty &lt; x &lt; \\infty, \\\\[2ex]\n0, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nNote: The Standard Normal Distribution has density with \\(\\mathbb{E}X = 0\\) and \\(\\mathbb{V}ar(X) = 1\\).\n\nX &lt;- rnorm(1000, 0, 1)\nqqnorm(X)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Approximate probabilities of being within 1, 2, 3 standard deviations\nmean(-1 &lt; X & X &lt; 1)  # ~ 68%\n\n[1] 0.684\n\nmean(-2 &lt; X & X &lt; 2)  # ~ 95%\n\n[1] 0.961\n\nmean(-3 &lt; X & X &lt; 3)  # ~ 99.7%\n\n[1] 1\n\n\n\n\n8.2.7 T-Distribution\nAnother special distribution in statistical inference is the Student’s t-Distribution. \\[f_X(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{\\Gamma\\!\\left(\\tfrac{\\nu+1}{2}\\right)}\n{\\sqrt{\\nu \\pi}\\,\\Gamma\\!\\left(\\tfrac{\\nu}{2}\\right)}\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{x^2}{\\nu}\\right)^{-\\tfrac{\\nu+1}{2}}, & -\\infty &lt; x &lt; \\infty, \\\\[2ex]\n0, & \\text{otherwise},\n\\end{cases}\\] where \\(\\nu\\) is the degrees of freedom. As \\(\\nu \\to \\infty\\), the pdf converges to the normal distribution.\n\n\n8.2.8 Implementation in R\n\nmy_df &lt;- 5\nX &lt;- rt(1000, df = my_df)\n\nmean(X); var(X)\n\n[1] 0.05605437\n\n\n[1] 1.793322\n\nmy_df / (my_df - 2)   # Theoretical variance for df &gt; 2\n\n[1] 1.666667\n\n\n\n\n8.2.9 Distribution Function Technique\nFor continuous random variables, a simple method for finding the probability density of a function of random variables is to find the distribution function and then differentiate to find the pdf.\nTo find an expression for the distribution function, let \\(Y = u(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)\\), where \\(u\\) is a function. Then, \\[F(Y) = P(Y \\leq y) = P(u(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n) \\leq y).\\] Then, \\[f(y) = \\frac{dF(Y)}{dy}.\\]\nExample:\n\n# Create sequence from 0 to 1\nt &lt;- seq(0, 1, length = 1000)\n\n# Define density function Y = 3 * (1 - t)^2\nY &lt;- 3 * (1 - t)^2\n\n# Plot density\nplot(t, Y, type = \"l\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Sample from t with probability weights Y\nZ &lt;- sample(t, 10000, replace = TRUE, prob = Y)\n\n# Histogram of sampled values\nhist(Z, freq = FALSE)\n\n# Overlay the density curve\nlines(t, Y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Apply transformation: X = (1 - Z)^3\nX.sample &lt;- (1 - Z)^3\n\n# Histogram of transformed sample\nhist(X.sample)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Compare with uniform distribution\nU &lt;- runif(10000)\n\n# QQ-plot to check distributional similarity\nqqplot(U, X.sample)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Correlation from QQ-plot\ncor(qqplot(U, X.sample)$x, qqplot(U, X.sample)$y)\n\n[1] 0.9998769\n\n\n\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Brian Pidgeon who kindly share the notes.",
